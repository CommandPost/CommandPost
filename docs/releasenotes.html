		    <h1>CommandPost 1.4.13</h1>

		    <h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Titles to Keywords Toolbox now supports audio clips on the primary storyline. Also, now if you have a title that spans across multiple clips, keywords will be applied to all the clips that intersect that title. Thanks Sam Pluemacher!</li>
                <li>We've updated the CommandPost Workflow Extension icon so that it's greyscale, matching the look of other Workflow Extension icons. This will look much better if CommandPost is the only Workflow Extension you have installed. Thanks for suggesting Byk Valkonen! Designed by the amazing Matthew Skiles!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Final Cut Pro v10.6.5 fixes a regression (introduced in v10.6.2) which prevented CommandPost from detecting selected clips within a secondary storyline. This meant, for example, if you had a clip selected in a secondary storyline and triggered Timeline Batch Export, CommandPost would think no clips are selected in the timeline. This is now fixed! Woohoo! Thanks Apple!</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in "Select Middle of Next/Previous Clip in the same storyline" actions. This now works again thanks to the above mentioned fix in Final Cut Pro v10.6.5. Thanks for reporting Nathen McEvoy!</li>
			</ul>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.12</h1>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed an issue in the "Auto Sequence" Toolbox where audio clips were not processed correctly. Thanks for reporting Florian Duffe!</li>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.11</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added support for the Razer Stream Controller.</li>
                <li>Added support for the Loupedeck Live-S.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added support for titles in secondary storylines to the Titles to Keywords Toolbox. Thanks for suggesting Knut Hake!</li>
                <li>Added a second text-box to the Titles to Keywords Toolbox, to be used for "common" keywords.</li>
                <li>Added a preference to "Add Space After Sequence" in the Titles to Keywords Toolbox. We also now add a "KEYWORD" role to every title.</li>
                <li>Added an option to "Treat FAVORITE and REJECT as Ratings instead of Keywords" in the Titles to Keywords Toolbox. When "Treat FAVORITE and REJECT as Ratings instead of Keywords" is enabled it will automatically create a "REJECT" and "FAVORITE" title when using "Create Titles from Text" (which also has a "REJECT" or "FAVORITE" role). We also now put the "Create Titles from Text" titles on a secondary storyline to make copying easier.</li>
                <li>When using "Create Titles from Text" in the Titles to Keywords Toolbox, we now alternate the positioning of the titles, so that you can more easily see them in the Final Cut Pro Viewer.</li>
                <li>Updated csv2notion to v0.3.5. Thanks for your amazing work Vladilen Zhdanov!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug where "Screens Backlight Level" wouldn't update correctly on Loupedeck devices.</li>
                <li>The warning popup that appears when using the reset buttons on the Loupedeck control surfaces panels now shows the correct control surface name (i.e. if you want to reset a Loupedeck Live, it now says Loupedeck Live instead of Loupedeck CT).</li>
			</ul>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.10</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added a new "Auto Sequence" Toolbox. When you drag a Final Cut Pro Project to this Toolbox, we'll send a new Project back to Final Cut Pro with the clips sorted by timecode (with or without gaps). Thanks for suggesting Knut Hake & Sam Pluemacher!</li>
                <li>Added a new "Sony Timecode Repair" Toolbox. Final Cut Pro currently doesn't always correctly interpret timecode from certain Sony Cameras that are recording into an MP4 wrapper. This Toolbox will update a Project's FCPXML to use the correct timecode values from the XML sidecar file (or the MP4 itself if no sidecar file exists), so that you can more easily send timelines from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve, Baselight or Adobe Premiere (with XtoCC). Thanks Alister Robbie & Jamie LeJeune!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvement</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>The "Titles to Keywords" Toolbox now supports connected clips above the Primary Storyline. This means that you can have a single title over the top of multiple clips, and all of those clips will get the same keyword from this title. Thanks for suggesting Knut Hake & Sam Pluemacher!</li>
			</ul>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.9</h1>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added some workarounds for macOS 13 Ventura Beta 22A5321da. Currently the Final Cut Pro "Edit > Start Dictation‚Ä¶" and "Edit > Emoji & Symbols" menu item actions will only work in English due to changes in macOS - we will try to search for a proper fix for this in the future for non-English users. Thanks for reporting Jeff Asher!</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.8</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvement</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>The <code>projectTimecode</code> token that can be used in Timeline Batch Export custom naming no longer uses dashes as separators (i.e. "00000000" instead of "00-00-00-00") so you more easily copy and paste into Final Cut Pro. Thanks for suggesting Ji≈ô√≠ Fiala!</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added missing action group labels for Razer Tartarus Chroma Applications & Banks. Thanks for reporting Frozner Videography!</li>
			</ul>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.7</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added support for the Razer Tartarus Chroma. Thanks for suggesting Frozner Videography!</li>
                <li>Added a <code>projectTimecode</code> token to the Timeline Batch Export custom naming feature, allowing you to insert the project timecode of where the clip starts to the filename. Thanks for suggesting Ji≈ô√≠ Fiala!</li>
                <li>Added action for "Toggle Zoom to Fit", allowing you to toggle between "Zoom to Fit" and your last zoom value. Thanks for suggesting Ji≈ô√≠ Fiala!</li>
                <li>Added action for "Toggle Zoom to Selection", allowing you to toggle between "Zoom to Selection" and your last zoom value. Thanks for suggesting Richard Taylor!</li>
                <li>Added individual actions for specific timeline zoom values (1 to 10 in 0.5 increments).</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the "Mouse Left Double Click" action.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.6</h1>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Disabling "Open Debug Console on Dock Icon Click" in the General Preferences still opened the Debug Console when clicking the dock icon. Thanks for reporting Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.5</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added an option to "Replace Commas With Alternative Commas" in the "Titles to Keywords" Toolbox. This is to workaround a bug in Final Cut Pro where it will split up a single keyword into multiple keywords when it detects a comma in the keyword name, when imported via a FCPXML. Thanks Knut Hake, Sam Pluemacher, Iain Anderson and Alex Gollner!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>The contextual menu will now appear when you right-click on the "Create Titles from Text" text editor in the "Titles to Keywords" Toolbox.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug that could cause a "nil" error in the Debug Console related to "topToBottomBaseAligned" sorting.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.4</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added a new "Titles to Keywords" Toolbox. When you drag a Final Cut Pro Event to this Toolbox (which must only contain a single Project), we will look through all the Titles connected to the clips in the Primary Storyline, read the name of those clips, then create new Keyword Ranges for each of those Titles. We then send that data back into Final Cut Pro automagically.</li>
                <li>We've also included a "Create Titles from Text" feature in this same Toolbox, that allows you to create a new Final Cut Pro Project which contains a new Title for every line in the Toolbox's text box - along with some additional formatting features, such as adding a prefix, suffix or sequential numbering. This allows you to easily copy and paste text from things like a PDF Script, convert them into Titles, adjust as required, then convert those Titles into Keywords. You can also setup the CommandPost Dock icon so that it automatically sends any dragged Events or FCPXML files directly to this new Toolbox. Thanks for suggesting Knut Hake & Sam Pluemacher! Thanks for testing Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>The "Shot Data" Toolbox icon has been updated. Thanks Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>In Final Cut Pro 10.6.2, Apple renamed the "Photos and Audio" menubar item to "Photos, Videos and Audio", which broke some automation features, like inserting specific Titles & Generators. This is now fixed. Thanks for reporting Trace Dominguez!</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug that could cause a "invalid order function for sorting" error in the Debug Console.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.3</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added the ability to upload directly to Notion from the Shot Data Toolbox. Thanks Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
                <li>Added a new Notion Toolbox allowing you to upload the Final Cut Pro Timeline Index and Browser Contents directly to Notion.</li>
                <li>Added two new drop-boxes in the General section of CommandPost‚Äôs preferences allowing you to set a ‚ÄúDrag & Drop Text Action‚Äù and a ‚ÄúDrag & Drop File Action‚Äù. This allows you to, for example, drag a Final Cut Pro project directly to the CommandPost dock icon to trigger the Vimeo Toolbox.</li>
                <li>Added a preference for ‚ÄúKey Repeat‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelay Until Repeat‚Äù in the Razer Control Surfaces panel. Thanks for suggesting Ross Batten!</li>
                <li>Added button that allows you to copy profiles between Razer devices in the Razer Control Surfaces panel. Thanks for suggesting Ross Batten!</li>
                <li>Added additional ‚ÄúPress & Hold‚Äù modifier actions. Thanks for suggesting Valerio D'Andrassi and No√© Moln√°r!</li>
                <li>Added actions to control Spotify. We‚Äôve also added a new ‚ÄúSpotify‚Äù section in the CommandPost Loupedeck Plugin for easy access.</li>
                <li>Added actions to "Increment/Decrement User Interface Element Under Mouse‚Äù. This allows you to hover your mouse over a slider, knob or text-box in Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve (for example), and use a control surface to control its value. We‚Äôve also added a new ‚ÄúmacOS: Accessibility‚Äù section in the CommandPost Loupedeck Plugin for easy access.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added missing labels to some Razer Action Groups.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the Color Board Angles actions. Thanks for reporting No√© Moln√°r!</li>
			</ul>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.2</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvement</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>The Loupedeck Plugin now requires Loupedeck 5.2 or later. The CommandPost Loupedeck Plugin has been updated so that unnecessary "reset" actions are no longer displayed in the LoupedeckConfig application - for example, the Cinematic Focus Point action, no longer has a "press" action associated with it (as it previously did nothing). This was a bug in the Loupedeck Plugin API that has now been addressed in version 5.2 of their software. Thanks Loupedeck Team!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed a regression that broke the "Unmount external drives when switching to battery power" and "Mount external drives when switching to AC power" features in the previous release.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.1</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Added support for the Razer Tartarus, Tartarus Pro, Nostromo & Orbweaver Chroma. We'd love to add support for the Tartarus Chroma too, but have been unable to get our hands on this older device as of yet - if you have one that you can donate, let us know!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>You can now "drag and drop" to re-arrange buttons in the Razer Control Surfaces panel. You can also right-click on buttons to copy, cut and paste buttons.</li>
                <li>We've also added a preference to "Prevent Excessive Thumb Taps", to workaround issues with the thumb button on older Razer devices where the thumb button becomes too sensitive over time. Thanks for suggesting Ross Batten!</li>
                <li>We now cache the Razer devices brightness to improve performance.</li>
                <li>Added preference to "Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup" and "Scan the Menubars of the Active Application", which are now off by default to improve CommandPost's startup time.</li>
                <li>We no longer load various Final Cut Pro plugins when Final Cut Pro isn't installed, to improve startup performance.</li>
                <li>The CommandPost Workflow Extension for Final Cut Pro is no longer installed if Final Cut Pro is not installed.</li>
                <li>The Skype Shortcuts plugin no longer loads if Skype isn't installed.</li>
                <li>The Zoom Shortcuts plugin no longer loads if Zoom isn't installed.</li>
                <li>We've changed the way the "Press & Hold" modifier key actions works for better performance.</li>
                <li>CommandPost now defaults to controlling the Final Cut Pro Trial, if the trial is already running when CommandPost starts, even if the full version is also installed. Thanks for suggesting Nathen McEvoy!</li>
                <li>Changed the wording from "Unknown" to "Not Installed" in the Debug Console if the Final Cut Pro version and/or path can't be detected.</li>
                <li>Improved the German translation in the Loupedeck Plugin. Thanks Jenny!</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed bugs related to the "Copy Control to All Banks" and "Reset Control" buttons in the Razer Preferences.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where "Unlisted & Ignored Applications" wouldn't work as intended on Razer devices.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where deleting a Custom User Application in Razer Preferences wouldn't update the user interface correctly.</li>

            <h1>CommandPost 1.4.0</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>We've added a new "Loupedeck Plugin" that acts as an alternative to our native/direct Loupedeck support - allowing you to access all of CommandPost's Final Cut Pro actions within the LoupedeckConfig application. This is really handy for users that have to jump between Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro, for example. All of your macOS Shortcuts macros and Keyboard Maestro macros will also appear in the LoupedeckConfig application automagically. There are also some macOS Spaces actions. Big thanks to the Loupedeck Team for their support - especially Jenny!</li>
                <li>Added support for the Razer Orbweaver. Big thanks to Ross Batten for giving us access to the hardware! We hope to add more Razer keyboards in the near future.</li>
                <li>We've added a new Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, which allows us to better control the playhead (which works great with control surfaces - such as the Loupedeck CT wheel). The Workflow Extension will only load when you trigger an action that requires it. When you first load the Workflow Extension it will try and make itself as small as possible and get out of the way - however you can move it to wherever you want, and like all Workflow Extensions its position is saved with your Workspace. There are new actions for "Move Playhead Forward/Backward" at different increments. There's no buttons on the Workflow Extension - it's currently simply an interface for us to control the playhead.</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Improved the colour accuracy of the Razer Tartarus V2 LEDs.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug in the Resolve Control Surfaces where the "RELATIVE FINE CONTROL" jog mode wouldn't trigger the correct jog mode on the hardware.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

            <h1>CommandPost 1.3.13</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>We've added a new "Relative (Fine Control)" Jog Wheel Mode for the Blackmagic Resolve Keyboards, which uses a different algorithm for more precise control, as some users found the jog wheel too sensitive and hard to navigate when in relative mode. We‚Äôve also added some additional sensitivity values, so you can further fine tune it to your liking. Thanks for your valuable feedback David Manganelli!</li>
                <li>We now forcefully update the LED lights on the Blackmagic Resolve Keyboards every 5 minutes to attempt to prevent the device from falling asleep. Thanks for reporting David Manganelli!</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed a regression introduced in the previous release which caused applying individual effects, transitions, titles and generators to clips in Final Cut Pro via a CommandPost action to fail unexpectedly. Thanks for reporting Fernando Pi√±ero & Andrew Griffiths!</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

		    <h1>CommandPost 1.3.12</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>CommandPost now remembers the menubar position if you change it by holding down COMMAND and dragging it to a new location.</li>
                <li>In the previous release of CommandPost if you tried to trigger a Final Cut Pro shortcut key that didn't actually have any keys assigned to it with the Final Cut Pro Command Editor, you'd be presented with an error message. This would sometime confuse users - for example, those using a Speed Editor which has the "Play Rate" shortcut keys assigned to the jog wheel - but Final Cut Pro doesn't assign anything to the "Play Rate" shortcuts by default. To improve this, if CommandPost tries to trigger a shortcut key that you haven't set up in Final Cut Pro, we'll now present you with a macOS Notification, which when clicked, takes you to the relevant Command within the Final Cut Pro Command Editor.</li>
                <li>CommandPost now disables support for displaying macOS Shortcut app shortcuts within the Search Console by default. To enable this functionality you must now manually enable it within the Shortcuts preferences panel within CommandPost. We have also added a new setup screen for new users, that allows you to enable shortcuts there. This is to prevent the shortcuts permission box from popping up the first time new users opened the Search Console.</li>
                <li>When you add a custom application to the Resolve Keyboards, it now automatically selects that application once added. Thanks for reporting D√°vid Szentmikl√≥si!</li>
                <li>We've improved how we cache the Jog Wheel mode on the DaVinci Resolve Keyboards.</li>
                <li>Improved the load times of the Resolve, Razer and TourBox Control Surface Panels.</li>
                <li>The Speed Editor battery status is now displayed in the preferences panel.</li>
                <li>Updated the default Resolve Keyboard layouts so that the JOG banks use menubar actions instead of shortcut key actions to improve performance. This will only change for new users, or if you reset your layout to "factory default".</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>If you delete an application, device or everything on the Resolve Keyboard panel, it now resets the "last application" if that custom application no longer exists in the preferences file.</li>
                <li>CommandPost now correctly determines the Final Cut Pro language when you change it via System Preferences within the Language & Region > Apps section. Thanks for reporting Sam Pluemacher - we had no idea this feature was added to macOS!</li>
                <li>System Preferences no longer quits when CommandPost starts up.</li>
                <li>CommandPost can now better detect when the Command Set is changed within Final Cut Pro.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug which prevented the Search Console from pre-populating the last action title in the Resolve Keyboard panel.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

		    <h1>CommandPost 1.3.11</h1>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug where Effects that contained special symbols in English would not be listed correctly in the Search Console when Final Cut Pro was not in English (i.e. the "Black & White" colour effect for Spanish users). Thanks for reporting Javier Beldamu!</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where CommandPost would fail to select the Effects Category when Final Cut Pro was in Spanish, so that when you tried to insert an Effect from the Search Console, it would always use the "All Video & Audio" category, making it slightly slower.</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where actions saved in English (i.e. all the default control surface layouts) would fail to trigger when Final Cut Pro was not in English. Thanks for reporting Peter Schroeder!</li>
                <li>Fixed a bug where the Search Console would fail to populate properly if Final Cut Pro was in Korean.</li>

		    <h1>CommandPost 1.3.10</h1>

            <h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>CommandPost now has the ability to read Final Cut Pro's Main Menu Structure directly (i.e. we can read the MainMenu.nib). MASSIVE THANK YOU to my partner-in-crime behind CommandPost, the incredible David Peterson. Whilst this won't really change anything for end users, it means that next time Apple pushes out an update - CommandPost will automatically read the new menubar structure without us having to push out an update. It also means "Show Duplicate Ranges" now appears in the "Menu Items" action group, not just the "Menu Items (Scanned)" action group.</li>
                <li>The Search HUD now shows options for "Original Codecs" and "Proxy Codecs".</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>We can now detect whether or not the timeline is in focus again - fixing various actions, such as "Set Spatial Conform Type".</li>
                <li>The "Set Spatial Conform Type" actions now work correctly when triggered from the Search Console.</li>
                <li>The "Show Horizon" action now works correctly when Final Cut Pro is in Korean.</li>
                <li>We've removed the Touch Bar debugging messages from the Debug Console.</li>
			</ul>

		    <hr />

		    <h1>CommandPost 1.3.9</h1>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fix</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>In Final Cut Pro 10.6.2, Apple has changed the file format where they store the main menu structure for Final Cut Pro (from a binary property list to a NIBArchive), and we're currently trying to work out how to read the new format - as it's undocumented, we're not sure how long it'll take us to solve. In the meantime, we've added a temporary workaround where we use the menu main structure from 10.6.1, so that you can continue to use CommandPost with this new release. New menu items (such as "Show Duplicate Ranges") will still be available in the Search Console as Command Editor Shortcuts and scanned menu items.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>üò≠ Known Issues</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>Currently we can't detect whether or not the Timeline is focussed in Final Cut Pro 10.6.2. This breaks some features such as "Set Spatial Conform Type", because we need to determine if you're selecting clips in the Browser or the Timeline - so CommandPost currently just assumes you're working in the browser. We'll investigate a workaround ASAP. If you spot any other Final Cut Pro 10.6.2 issues or bugs, please let us know!</li>
			</ul>

            <h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>We now scan the "additional" commands in Final Cut Pro. This means there are now keyboard command set actions for "Next Focus Point", "Previous Focus Point", "Cinematic Tool" and "Cinematic Editor" (and any future "additional" commands Apple adds in the future).</li>

                <li>The "Insert Action" button in the Snippets Editor now correctly formats code with non-standard characters, like the command icon you see on your keyboard. Previously inserted actions still work - they just look a bit weird. Thanks for reporting Marc Bach!</li>

			<li>Fixed some user interface issues in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences when the interface is in Dutch. Thanks for reporting Jeroen van Amerongen!</li>
			<li>The default Loupedeck Live layout incorrectly had actions for the Loupedeck CT, which just made things very confusing. This has now been corrected.</li></ul>

			<h1>CommandPost 1.2.0</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>We have a new dock and menubar icon by the incredible Matthew Skiles. Woohoo!</li>
			<li>We have also added the option to select 5 new built-in menubar icons, or select any image from your machine to use as a menubar icon. You can also now customise the menubar text label for full control.</li>
			<li>We now support the Monogram and Palette control surfaces. CommandPost integrates closely with the Monogram Creator, so once you enable Monogram support in CommandPost, you can jump into Monogram Creator to set up your layout. It also supports Automatic Profile Switching. Monogram support requires the latest beta or alpha builds of Monogram Creator - it won't work on the public release yet. Any ideas, comments, suggestions welcome!</li>
			<li>You can now use Lua Snippets to programatically generate Loupedeck CT/Live icons, and also define the LED color. With some simple lines of code, you can now make your Loupedeck device appear exactly how you want it. There's a new option in the preferences to adjust the refresh frequency (defaults to 1 second).</li>
			<li>Added option to "Resize Images on Import" and set a custom "Image Background Colour on Import" in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panel.</li>
			<li>Added ability to customise the font, font size and colour of text labels in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panel.</li>
			<li>Added the ability to consolidate images when using the Shot Data Toolbox. This means if you have any images "connected" to the Shot Data Motion Template in your timeline, they'll be copied to the same location as the CSV export. Thanks for the suggestion Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Added actions to control the individual red, green and blue parameters for the Color Wheels in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li></ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>We've renamed "All Applications" to "Unlisted & Ignored Applications" in the Control Surfaces panels to better describe what this option does.</li>
			<li>We've improved how the Search Console searches and orders the results.</li>
			<li>Updated all the translations, and improved the Lua documentation.</li>
			<li>Various user interface improvements in the Preferences and Control Surfaces windows.</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug in both the Shot Data Toolbox, Save Browser Contents to CSV and Save Timeline Index to CSV. Thanks for reporting Aaron Villa!</li>

			<li>Various improvements and bug fixes in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panels - especially in regards to dragging and dropping icons. Thanks to Eric Badura for all your testing and ideas!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.5</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>If you assign an action to a Loupedeck CT/Live Touchscreen button that has an image in the Search Console, that image will now be automatically applied to the button. For example, if you apply the action to launch Disk Utility to a Loupedeck CT/Live Touchscreen Button, the Disk Utility icon will be automatically applied. Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>You can now select Applications (in addition to image files) when you click the Image Drop Zone in the Loupedeck CT/Live Control Surfaces panel.</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.4</h1>

			<h2>üí™ Changes</h2>
			<ul><li>On a fresh installation, CommandPost will no longer ask you if you want to copy the CommandPost application to your application folder. Instead, you should manually copy CommandPost to the application folder via the Applications shortcut in the DMG package. This has been changed to get around issues where people want to install CommandPost in their user-specific application folder, or when there's permission issues trying to copy CommandPost across, which can happen on some Big Sur installations.</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed the "Zoom to selection" action in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for reporting Jeffrey Linneman!</li>
			<li>Fixed the "Save Current Frame" option in the Final Cut Pro Viewer Overlay popup. Thanks for reporting David Brown!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.3</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>Added actions that adjust the Position controls in Final Cut Pro's inspector in reverse using MIDI. Thanks Joe Dull!</li>
			<li>Added an action to "Toggle Opacity Fade Handles in Video Animation Popup on Selected Clips". Thanks for the suggestion Ripple Training! Unfortunately, due to a bug in Final Cut Pro's Accessibility API this doesn't work for clips within a secondary storyline container.</li>
			<li>Added preferences to change the Search Console width and height. This can be found when you right click on the Search Console. Each individual Search Console has its own unique width and height (i.e. the Search Console in Final Cut Pro can be different than in After Effects).</li></ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>DaVinci Resolve & After Effects Tangent support is now disabled by default on a fresh install.</li>
			<li>Updated the Shot Data Motion Template, so that it works with all common aspect ratios. Thanks Iain Anderson!</li>
			<li>We've removed the EULA from the CommandPost DMG, and updated the tag-line to match the website.</li>
			<li>We've adjusted the window sizes on Big Sur so there's not as much wasted space at the bottom of the windows.</li>
			<li>The Shared Pasteboard will no longer prompt you on CommandPost's startup if the shared folder is not accessible. This means that if you're using something like PostLab Drive, the Shared Pasteboard will now work when the drive is connected, and you won't get notified if the drive becomes disconnected. Thanks for reporting Dale Ryan Leckie!</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug where the menu bar actions had the wrong menu path in the Search Console subtext.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where you will be asked for Accessibility Permissions straight away on a fresh install. Thanks for reporting Iain Anderson!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.2</h1>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug that could cause the hue control in the Final Cut Pro Colour Wheels to change its value to 90 degrees when CommandPost first loads, if the Colour Wheel is active on a clip. Thanks for reporting Valerio D'Andrassi.</li></ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>The Shot Data Motion Template has been updated. Thanks Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.1</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>We've added some caching to dramatically increase the responsiveness of control surfaces, such as the Loupedeck CT. This has massive improvements for controlling the Color Wheels with the Loupedeck CT Touch Screen, for example.</li></ul>

			<h2>üÜï New Actions</h2>
			<ul><li>We've added new actions to control the Final Cut Pro Color Board, by increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10. They are all contained within their own Action Group called "Color Board" on the Search Console. Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed the Hue controls on Tangent Panels. Thanks for reporting Robert J. Bradshaw!</li>
			<li>Fixed an error that could occur randomly when refreshing Loupedeck devices. Thanks for reporting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>Some actions that used popup menus (such as "Show Horizon") weren't working correctly. This is now fixed. Thanks for reporting Adam Terlanda!</li>
			<li>Some fields weren't being correctly exported in the Shot Data Toolbox Utility. This is now fixed. Thanks for reporting Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug which cause a MIDI error when launching CommandPost 1.1 or later for the first time. Thanks for reporting Scott Dodson!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where Stream Deck settings weren't migrated from CommandPost 1.0.6 (or earlier) to 1.1 (or later). The Final Cut Pro and All Applications settings are now automatically migrated to the Stream Deck Unit 1.</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.0</h1>

			<h2>üéõ Control Surfaces Support</h2>
			<ul><li>Control Surfaces have been moved out of Preferences into their own window.</li>
			<li>Added Loupedeck (original), Loupedeck CT and Loupedeck Live support.</li>
			<li>Added Stream Deak XL and Stream Deck Mini support.</li>
			<li>Added TourBox support.</li>
			<li>Added placeholder Control Surface panels for Monogram and Gamepad, with an explanation of how to use these control surfaces with CommandPost until we add built-in support.</li>
			<li>MIDI, Loupedeck &amp; Stream Deck Preferences panels now support Custom Applications.</li>
			<li>AudioSwift now correctly works with CommandPost&#39;s MIDI functionality. Thanks for reporting Nigel Rios!</li>
			<li>Added Skype, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Disk Utility, System Preferences and TextEdit to the default Control Surfaces application drop-down lists. However, currently there is only basic keyboard shortcut actions for Skype.</li>
			<li>Tangent panel support has been re-engineered to support multiple CommandPost applications within Tangent Mapper (i.e. you can now have a completely seperate Tangent Mapper layout for Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve). Better support for DaVinci Resolve will come in a future beta - this release it just laying the foundations.</li></ul>

			<h2>üß∞ Toolbox Utilities</h2>
			<ul><li>The FCPXML Titles Processor allows you update the titles within a FCPXML, based on new data from a CSV file. This utility was commissioned by Connor Eberhart.</li>
			<li>Shot Data is new specialised Toolbox utility that allows you to import a FCPXML which contains one or more Shot Data Titles in a timeline, and converts the data from these Motion Templates into a single CSV file for use in other applications. This feature has been commissioned by Vigneswaran Rajkumar for his upcoming feature film.</li></ul>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>Added non-keyboard shortcut actions for Final Cut Pro Browser Clip Height &amp; Browser Duration.</li>
			<li>Added speed rate actions for 40, 50, and 200.</li>
			<li>Added actions to increase and decrease display brightness.</li>
			<li>Added actions for adjusting opacity in Final Cut Pro.</li>
			<li>Added actions for Filmstrip &amp; List Mode in the Final Cut Pro Browser.</li>
			<li>Added a Contrast action for Final Cut Pro which adjusts shadows &amp; highlights brightness at the same time.</li>
			<li>Added actions for Timeline Zoom (using the Appearance Popup). Thanks for suggesting Prescott Van Leer!</li>
			<li>All your Keyboard Maestro Macros are now available in the Search Console as actions.</li>
			<li>Added initial support for Adobe After Effects. There are now actions for each individual effect in After Effects, as well as actions for all the shortcut keys and menubar items.</li>
			<li>Added actions for Zoom keyboard shortcuts. Thanks for your assistance Jonathan Zuck!</li>
			<li>CommandPost can now generate menu bar actions for all Custom Applications.</li>
			<li>Added an option to create Captions when using the Text To Speech feature in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for the suggestion Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Added actions that allow you to &quot;emulate&quot; a Tangent Element panel in DaVinci Resolve. This feature requires Tangent support to be enabled, and at least one physical Tangent device to be connected to your machine (i.e. a Tangent Ripple). This means you can now use Tangent Mapper to customise your DaVinci Resolve layout for any Tangent panel, as well as trigger Tangent actions from any other control surface or shortcut key (i.e. you can control a colour wheel from a Loupedeck CT or TourBox). It also means you can control DaVinci Resolve from a Tangent Arc or CP200.</li>
			<li>Added a Contrast Color Wheel control to Tangent Mapper. Thanks for suggesting Von Jackson!</li></ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>Recompiled CommandPost to natively support Apple Silicon.</li>
			<li>Improved the method we detect &quot;Screen Recording&quot; permissions on macOS Catalina &amp; Big Sur.</li>
			<li>We now use Sentry instead of Firebase Crashlytics for tracking crashes.</li>
			<li>CommandPost now uses Lua 5.4.</li>
			<li>We&#39;ve made lots of changes and improvements to our underlying Final Cut Pro X API. These changes should make writing your own Lua Snippets a lot more simple and easy to understand.</li>
			<li>The Search Console now loads faster, and displays a &quot;loading&quot; message when the contents of the Search Console is still populating. We&#39;ve also adjusted the way the Search Console orders its results to improve usability.</li>
			<li>Added more Touch Bar icons. Thanks Daniele Di Tuccio!</li>
			<li>Changed the way we trigger shortcut keys for better performance.</li>
			<li>HUD now watches for Viewer resizing.</li>
			<li>Browser Playhead Highlight now follows playhead when visible.</li>
			<li>&quot;Select Clips Forward/Backwards&quot; actions now selects clips with speed handles.</li>

			<li>Removed unnecessary &quot;Failed to cache User Effects Presets‚Äù debug message in Plugin Scanner.</li>
			<li>Added option to enable/disable all draggable guides in Final Cut Pro Viewer Overlay.</li>
			<li>Improved the performance of the Video Inspector actions.</li>
			<li>Improved the MIDI Controls for Colour Wheels, so that you can use both the horizontal and vertical actions at the same time. This allows you to use the controls smoothly in AudioSwift using X/Y mode. Thanks for reporting Nigel Rios!</li>
			<li>Added relative MIDI actions for controlling the Final Cut Pro Colour Board. Thanks Nigel Rios!</li>
			<li>We now just play an error sound instead of showing a dialog box when a menubar action cannot be triggered. Thanks Knut Hake!</li>
			<li>You can now use a velocity value for the &quot;Note Off&quot; and &quot;Note On&quot; MIDI commands. The velocity is also now detected and filled out in the MIDI Preferences panel when you use the &quot;Learn&quot; button. Thanks Nigel Rios!</li>

			<li>The &quot;Text to Speech&quot; feature has been re-designed and improved.</li>
			<li>Actions that trigger virtual keyboard presses now take into account any modifier keys triggered by the &quot;Press and hold Modifier Key&quot; actions. Thanks for reporting Flavio Saramin!</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed Touch Bar support on 16-inch MacBook Pro.</li>

			<li>Fixed a bug where the Search Console was incorrectly case sensitive.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the individual &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Pause&quot; actions from functioning. A better description for these actions has also been added to the Search Console, so that it&#39;s clearer to understand their purpose (i.e. the play button only plays - it won&#39;t stop playback). Thanks for reporting Prescott Van Leer!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where Colour Wheel actions wouldn&#39;t not automatically change to the Colour Wheel Inspector if you were on the Colour Curves. Thanks for reporting Prescott Van Leer!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in the Timeline Batch Export tool, where sometimes CommandPost could fail to change the destination directory.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug which prevented MIDI commands from applying correctly if you manually entered them in the MIDI Preferences panel (as opposed to using the &quot;Learn&quot; button). Thanks Nigel Rios!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in the Text to Speech function and Media Watch Folders where certain non-alphanumeric characters in filenames could cause the functions to fail. Thanks for reporting Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug which prevented Color Wheels from opening correctly in the Final Cut Pro Inspector when you moved a Tangent wheel or knob.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in MIDI Timeline Scroll action.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the &quot;Leave Files in Place&quot; menubar item tick was incorrectly reversed. Thanks for reporting Mark Westcott!</li>

			<li>Fixed a bug with the Jog/Shuttle control for Tangent Panels in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for reporting Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where a deleted Media Watch Folder would reappear when you restarted CommandPost. Thanks for reporting Erik Lathouwers, Matt Steeves &amp; Ji≈ô√≠ Fiala!</li>

			<li>Added actions to trigger custom keyboard shortcuts (for example COMMAND+C).</li></ul>

			<h2>üí™ Changes</h2>
			<ul><li>CommandPost will now prompt for Screen Recording permissions on macOS Catalina, and will not start until those permissions are granted.

We also allow users to optionally share screenshots when submitting feedback.</li>
			<li>The CommandPost Dock Item is now disabled by default. You can change this in CommandPost's General Preferences panel if required.</li>
			<li>The contextual menu that appears when you right-click on the top of the Final Cut Pro Viewer is now disabled by default. You now have to click "Enable Viewer Contextual Menu" from the CommandPost menubar to enable it.</li>

			<li>CommandPost now disconnects from Tangent Hub when the Color Finale 2 window is open, allowing you to control Color Finale 2 with Tangent Panels. When you close the Color Finale 2 window, CommandPost reconnects to Tangent Hub.</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>The "Select Active/Topmost Library in Browser" actions now put focus on the Browser Sidebar when triggered so that the Library becomes active in the Inspector. Thanks for reporting Mads Larsen Nielsen!</li>

			<li>Updated the Final Cut Pro, Motion & Compressor Feedback Form assistant.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug when disabling the Custom Touch Bar on Mojave.</li></ul>

			<h2>üß® Workarounds</h2>
			<ul><li>The Touch Bar features are currently not working correctly on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro so we have temporarily disabled Touch Bar support on these machines until we can come up with a proper fix. If anyone has any ideas, please get in touch.</li></ul>

			<h2>ÁøªË®≥ Translations</h2>

			<ul><li>Added Polish Translation. Thanks Robert!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.0.0</h1>
