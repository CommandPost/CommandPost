			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>Added option to "Ignore Every Second P1 to P8 Wheel Command" and "Ignore Every Second Control Dial Command" in the Loupedeck+ Preferences panel.

			<li>Added an action to copy the Final Cut Pro Viewer contents to the Pasteboard. Thanks for suggesting Alex Gollner!</li>
			<li>Added an action to "commit multicam" within Final Cut Pro using automation. It‚Äôs a bit clunky, but it works. We essential ‚ÄúReveal in Angle Editor‚Äù, then ‚ÄúReveal in Browser‚Äù, mark an in-point, then connect that clip back on top of the timeline. Essentially a macro, like Timeline Batch Export. One day I hope to use the Pasteboard instead to make it a one click thing. Thanks for suggesting Knut Hake & Sam Pluemacher!</li>
			<li>Added actions to control the Anchor controls within the Final Cut Pro Video Inspector.</li>
			<li>Added actions to reset Compositing, Crop, Distort and Transform within the Final Cut Pro Video Inspector. Thanks for suggesting Nariman Gafurov!</li>

			<ul><li>The wording on Monogram Preferences panel has been changed. You can now use the public version of Monogram Creator 4.1.11 or later, as opposed to just the beta and alpha releases.</li>

			<li>Added actions for triggering virtual mouse clicks. Thanks for suggesting Chase Guidroz!</li></ul>

			<h2>üí™ Changes</h2>
			<ul><li>The setup screen no longer refers to the "satellite icon". Thanks for reporting Shahin Shokoui!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.2.2</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>Improved the Search Console so that, for example, if you open it when setting up a layout for Final Cut Pro in the Loupedeck CT preferences, it now shows Final Cut Pro actions by default - but you still have access to all the other application actions by using one of the toolbar icons, or right-clicking on the Search Console to change which Action Groups you want to filter.</li>
			<li>Added a preference to the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences to "Automatically Apply Icon From Action". Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>We now automatically add a text label based on the action title, when you assign an action in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences.</li>
			<li>Added an action to "Reset Color Wheel" in Final Cut Pro, which resets all the controls for the selected color wheel. Thanks for suggesting Matthew H Green!</li>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug where enabling then disabling a Loupedeck CT/Live vibration control wouldn't actually disable it, requiring you to reset the whole control to get rid of the vibration. Thanks for reporting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>Fixes some mistakes in the German language translation for CommandPost. Thanks for reporting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where resetting the Color Wheels on a Tangent Panel would not work correctly. Thanks for reporting Richard Guinand!</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in our Final Cut Pro Angle Editor API. Thanks for reporting Sam Pluemacher!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.2.1</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>When you click an action select button in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panel, if there was previously an action already assigned, this name will now be automatically populated in the Search Console.</li>
			<li>When you click an action select button in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panel, the selected action groups will now default to whatever application you currently have selected in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences. For example, if you're changing the layout for TextEdit, which you click an action select button, only the actions for TextEdit will appear by default. However, you can still access all the other application actions via the toolbar, or the right-click menu for complete control.		</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug in the Loupedeck CT/Live manager, where resizing some legacy icons could fail, preventing the Loupedeck screens from updating correctly. Thanks for reporting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>Fixed some user interface issues in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences when the interface is in Dutch. Thanks for reporting Jeroen van Amerongen!</li>
			<li>The default Loupedeck Live layout incorrectly had actions for the Loupedeck CT, which just made things very confusing. This has now been corrected.</li></ul>

			<li>We now support the Monogram and Palette control surfaces. CommandPost integrates closely with the Monogram Creator, so once you enable Monogram support in CommandPost, you can jump into Monogram Creator to set up your layout. It also supports Automatic Profile Switching. Monogram support requires the latest beta or alpha builds of Monogram Creator - it won't work on the public release yet. Any ideas, comments, suggestions welcome!</li>
			<li>You can now use Lua Snippets to programatically generate Loupedeck CT/Live icons, and also define the LED color. With some simple lines of code, you can now make your Loupedeck device appear exactly how you want it. There's a new option in the preferences to adjust the refresh frequency (defaults to 1 second).</li>
			<li>Added option to "Resize Images on Import" and set a custom "Image Background Colour on Import" in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panel.</li>
			<li>Added ability to customise the font, font size and colour of text labels in the Loupedeck CT/Live Preferences panel.</li>
			<li>Added the ability to consolidate images when using the Shot Data Toolbox. This means if you have any images "connected" to the Shot Data Motion Template in your timeline, they'll be copied to the same location as the CSV export. Thanks for the suggestion Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Added actions to control the individual red, green and blue parameters for the Color Wheels in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li></ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>We've renamed "All Applications" to "Unlisted & Ignored Applications" in the Control Surfaces panels to better describe what this option does.</li>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.5</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>If you assign an action to a Loupedeck CT/Live Touchscreen button that has an image in the Search Console, that image will now be automatically applied to the button. For example, if you apply the action to launch Disk Utility to a Loupedeck CT/Live Touchscreen Button, the Disk Utility icon will be automatically applied. Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li>
			<li>You can now select Applications (in addition to image files) when you click the Image Drop Zone in the Loupedeck CT/Live Control Surfaces panel.</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.4</h1>

			<h2>üí™ Changes</h2>
			<ul><li>On a fresh installation, CommandPost will no longer ask you if you want to copy the CommandPost application to your application folder. Instead, you should manually copy CommandPost to the application folder via the Applications shortcut in the DMG package. This has been changed to get around issues where people want to install CommandPost in their user-specific application folder, or when there's permission issues trying to copy CommandPost across, which can happen on some Big Sur installations.</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed the "Zoom to selection" action in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for reporting Jeffrey Linneman!</li>
			<li>Fixed the "Save Current Frame" option in the Final Cut Pro Viewer Overlay popup. Thanks for reporting David Brown!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.3</h1>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>Added actions that adjust the Position controls in Final Cut Pro's inspector in reverse using MIDI. Thanks Joe Dull!</li>
			<li>Added an action to "Toggle Opacity Fade Handles in Video Animation Popup on Selected Clips". Thanks for the suggestion Ripple Training! Unfortunately, due to a bug in Final Cut Pro's Accessibility API this doesn't work for clips within a secondary storyline container.</li>
			<li>Added preferences to change the Search Console width and height. This can be found when you right click on the Search Console. Each individual Search Console has its own unique width and height (i.e. the Search Console in Final Cut Pro can be different than in After Effects).</li></ul>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>
			<ul><li>DaVinci Resolve & After Effects Tangent support is now disabled by default on a fresh install.</li>
			<li>Updated the Shot Data Motion Template, so that it works with all common aspect ratios. Thanks Iain Anderson!</li>
			<li>We've removed the EULA from the CommandPost DMG, and updated the tag-line to match the website.</li>
			<li>We've adjusted the window sizes on Big Sur so there's not as much wasted space at the bottom of the windows.</li>
			<li>The Shared Pasteboard will no longer prompt you on CommandPost's startup if the shared folder is not accessible. This means that if you're using something like PostLab Drive, the Shared Pasteboard will now work when the drive is connected, and you won't get notified if the drive becomes disconnected. Thanks for reporting Dale Ryan Leckie!</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug where the menu bar actions had the wrong menu path in the Search Console subtext.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where you will be asked for Accessibility Permissions straight away on a fresh install. Thanks for reporting Iain Anderson!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed a bug that could cause the hue control in the Final Cut Pro Colour Wheels to change its value to 90 degrees when CommandPost first loads, if the Colour Wheel is active on a clip. Thanks for reporting Valerio D'Andrassi.</li></ul>

			<ul><li>The Shot Data Motion Template has been updated. Thanks Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li></ul>

			<hr />

			<h1>CommandPost 1.1.1</h1>

			<h2>üî® Improvements</h2>

			<h2>üÜï New Actions</h2>
			<ul><li>We've added new actions to control the Final Cut Pro Color Board, by increments of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10. They are all contained within their own Action Group called "Color Board" on the Search Console. Thanks for suggesting Eric Badura!</li></ul>

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>Fixed the Hue controls on Tangent Panels. Thanks for reporting Robert J. Bradshaw!</li>

			<li>MIDI, Loupedeck &amp; Stream Deck Preferences panels now support Custom Applications.</li>
			<li>AudioSwift now correctly works with CommandPost&#39;s MIDI functionality. Thanks for reporting Nigel Rios!</li>
			<li>Added Skype, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Disk Utility, System Preferences and TextEdit to the default Control Surfaces application drop-down lists. However, currently there is only basic keyboard shortcut actions for Skype.</li>
			<li>Tangent panel support has been re-engineered to support multiple CommandPost applications within Tangent Mapper (i.e. you can now have a completely seperate Tangent Mapper layout for Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve). Better support for DaVinci Resolve will come in a future beta - this release it just laying the foundations.</li></ul>

			<h2>üß∞ Toolbox Utilities</h2>
			<ul><li>The FCPXML Titles Processor allows you update the titles within a FCPXML, based on new data from a CSV file. This utility was commissioned by Connor Eberhart.</li>
			<li>Shot Data is new specialised Toolbox utility that allows you to import a FCPXML which contains one or more Shot Data Titles in a timeline, and converts the data from these Motion Templates into a single CSV file for use in other applications. This feature has been commissioned by Vigneswaran Rajkumar for his upcoming feature film.</li></ul>

			<h2>üéâ New Features</h2>
			<ul><li>Added non-keyboard shortcut actions for Final Cut Pro Browser Clip Height &amp; Browser Duration.</li>
			<li>Added speed rate actions for 40, 50, and 200.</li>
			<li>Added actions to increase and decrease display brightness.</li>
			<li>Added actions for adjusting opacity in Final Cut Pro.</li>
			<li>Added actions for Filmstrip &amp; List Mode in the Final Cut Pro Browser.</li>
			<li>Added a Contrast action for Final Cut Pro which adjusts shadows &amp; highlights brightness at the same time.</li>
			<li>Added actions for Timeline Zoom (using the Appearance Popup). Thanks for suggesting Prescott Van Leer!</li>
			<li>All your Keyboard Maestro Macros are now available in the Search Console as actions.</li>
			<li>Added initial support for Adobe After Effects. There are now actions for each individual effect in After Effects, as well as actions for all the shortcut keys and menubar items.</li>
			<li>Added actions for Zoom keyboard shortcuts. Thanks for your assistance Jonathan Zuck!</li>
			<li>CommandPost can now generate menu bar actions for all Custom Applications.</li>
			<li>Added an option to create Captions when using the Text To Speech feature in Final Cut Pro. Thanks for the suggestion Vigneswaran Rajkumar!</li>
			<li>Added actions that allow you to &quot;emulate&quot; a Tangent Element panel in DaVinci Resolve. This feature requires Tangent support to be enabled, and at least one physical Tangent device to be connected to your machine (i.e. a Tangent Ripple). This means you can now use Tangent Mapper to customise your DaVinci Resolve layout for any Tangent panel, as well as trigger Tangent actions from any other control surface or shortcut key (i.e. you can control a colour wheel from a Loupedeck CT or TourBox). It also means you can control DaVinci Resolve from a Tangent Arc or CP200.</li>
			<li>Added a Contrast Color Wheel control to Tangent Mapper. Thanks for suggesting Von Jackson!</li></ul>

			<li>We now just play an error sound instead of showing a dialog box when a menubar action cannot be triggered. Thanks Knut Hake!</li>

			<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the individual &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Pause&quot; actions from functioning.

			<h2>üêû Bug Fixes</h2>
			<ul><li>The "Select Active/Topmost Library in Browser" actions now put focus on the Browser Sidebar when triggered so that the Library becomes active in the Inspector. Thanks for reporting Mads Larsen Nielsen!</li>
