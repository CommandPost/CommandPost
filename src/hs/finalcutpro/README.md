# Final Cut Pro Module

This module provides an API to work with the FCPX application. There are a couple of types of files:

* `init.lua` - the main module that gets imported.
* `axutils.lua` - some utility functions for working with `axuielement` objects.
* `test.lua` - some support functions for testing. TODO: Make this better.

Generally, you will `require` the `hs.finalcutpro` module to import it, like so:

```lua
local fcp = require("hs.finalcutpro")
```

Then, there are the `UpperCase` files, which represent the application itself:

* `App` 		- The root FCPX application.
* `MenuBar` 	- The main menu bar.
* `prefs/PreferencesWindow` - The preferences window.
* etc...

The `App` is the root application. It is accessed like so:

```lua
fcp:app()
```

The `App` has functions which allow you to perform tasks or access parts of the UI. For example, to open the `Preferences` window, you can do this:

```lua
fcp:app():preferencesWindow():show()
```

In general, as long as FCPX is running, actions can be performed directly, and the API will perform the required operations to achieve it. For example, to toggle the 'Create Optimized Media' checkbox in the 'Import' section of the 'Preferences' window, you can simply do this:

```lua
fcp:app():preferencesWindow():importPanel():toggleCreateOptimizedMedia()
```

The API will automatically open the `Preferences` window, navigate to the 'Import' panel and toggle the checkbox.

The `UpperCase` classes also have a variety of `UI` methods. These will return the `axuielement` for the relevant GUI element, if it is accessible. If not, it will return `nil`. These allow direct interaction with the GUI if necessary. It's most useful when adding new functions to `UpperCase` files for a particular element.

This can also be used to 'wait' for an element to be visible before performing a task. For example, if you need to wait for the `Preferences` window to finish loading before doing something else, you can do this with the `hs.just` library:

```lua
local just = require("hs.just")

local prefsWindow = fcp:app():preferencesWindow()

local prefsUI = just.doUntil(function() return prefsWindow:UI())

if prefsUI then
	-- it's open!
else
	-- it's closed!
end
```

By using the `just` library, we can do a loop waiting until the function returns a result that will give up after a certain time period (10 seconds by default).

Of course, we have a specific support function for that already, so you could do this instead:

```lua
if fcp:app():preferencesWindow():isShowing() then
	-- it's open!
else
	-- it's closed!
end
```
