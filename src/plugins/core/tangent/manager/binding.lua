--- Returns the `name` of this binding.
---
--- Parameters:
---   * None

end

--- plugins.core.tangent.manager.binding:member(parameter) -> self
--- Method

--- Method
--- Adds the list of parameters to this binding.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * ...   - the list of parameters to bind.
---
--- Returns:
---  * The `binding` instance.
