--- === cp.prop ===
---
--- This is a utility library for helping keep track of single-value property states. Each property provides access to a single value. Must be readable, but may be read-only. It works by creating a table which has a `get` and (optionally) a `set` function which are called when changing the state.
---
--- ## Features
--- ### 1. Callable
--- A `prop` can be called like a function once created. Eg:
---
--- ```lua
--- local value = true
--- local propValue = prop.new(function() return value end, function(newValue) value = newValue end)
--- propValue() == true     -- `value` is still true
--- propValue(false) == false   -- now `value` is false
--- ```
---
--- ### 2. Togglable
--- A `prop` comes with toggling built in - as long as the it has a `set` function. Continuing from the last example:
---
--- ```lua
--- propValue:toggle()  -- `value` went from `false` to `true`.
--- ```
---
---  **Note:** Toggling a non-boolean value will flip it to `nil` and a subsequent toggle will make it `true`. See the [toggle method](#toggle) for more details.
---
--- ### 3. Watchable
--- Interested parties can 'watch' the `prop` value to be notified of changes. Again, continuing on:
---
--- ```lua
--- propValue:watch(function(newValue) print "New Value: "...newValue) end) -- prints "New Value: true" immediately
--- propValue(false)    -- prints "New Value: false"
--- ```
---
--- This will also work on [AND](#and) and [OR][#or] properties. Any changes from component properties will trigger a notification.
---
--- ### 4. Combinable
--- We can combine or modify properties with AND/OR and NOT operations. The resulting values will be a live combination of the underlying `prop` values. They can also be watched, and will be notified when the underlying `prop` values change. For example:
---
--- ```lua
--- local watered   = prop.TRUE()               -- a simple `prop` which stores the current value internally, defaults to `true`
--- local fed       = prop.FALSE()              -- same as above, defautls to `false`
--- local rested    = prop.FALSE()              -- as above.
--- local satisfied = watered:AND(fed)        -- will be true if both `watered` and `fed` are true.
--- local happy     = satisfied:AND(rested)   -- will be true if both `satisfied` and `happy`.
--- local sleepy    = fed:AND(prop.NOT(rested)) -- will be sleepy if `fed`, but not `rested`.
---
--- -- These statements all evaluate to `true`
--- satisfied()     == false
--- happy()         == false
--- sleepy()        == false
---
--- -- Get fed
--- fed(true)       == true
--- satisfied()     == true
--- happy()         == false
--- sleepy()        == true
---
--- -- Get rest
--- rested:toggle() == true
--- satisfied()     == true
--- happy()         == true
--- sleepy()        == false
---
--- -- These will produce an error, because you can't modify an AND or OR:
--- happy(true)
--- happy:toggle()
--- ```
---
--- You can also use non-boolean properties. Any non-`nil` value is considered to be `true`.
---
--- ## 5. Immutable
--- If appropriate, a `prop` may be immutable. Any `prop` with no `set` function defined is immutable. Examples are the `prop.AND` and `prop.OR` instances, since modifying combinations of values doesn't really make sense.
---
--- Additionally, an immutable wrapper can be made from any `prop` value via either `prop.IMMUTABLE(...)` or calling the `myValue:IMMUTABLE()` method.
---
--- Note that the underlying `prop` value(s) are still potentially modifiable, and any watchers on the immutable wrapper will be notified of changes. You just can't make any changes directly to the immutable property instance.
---
--- For example:
---
--- ```lua
--- local isImmutable = propValue:IMMUTABLE()
--- isImmutable:toggle()    -- results in an `error` being thrown
--- isImmutable:watch(function(newValue) print "isImmutable changed to "..newValue end)
--- propValue:toggle()      -- prints "isImmutable changed to false"
--- ```
---
--- ## 6. Bindable
--- A property can be bound to an 'owning' table. This table will be passed into the `get` and `set` functions for the property if present. This is mostly useful if your property depends on internal instance values of a table. For example, you might want to make a property work as a method instead of a function:
---
--- ```lua
--- local owner = {
---    _value = true
--- }
--- owner.value = prop(function() return owner._value end)
--- owner:isMethod() -- error!
--- ```
---
--- To use a `prop` as a method, you need to `attach` it to the owning table, like so:
---
--- ```lua
--- local owner = {
---     _value = true
--- }
--- owner.isMethod = prop(function(self) return self._value end, function(value, self) self._value = value end):bind(owner)
--- owner:isMethod()                -- success!
--- owner.isMethod()                -- also works - will still pass in the bound owner.
--- owner.isMethod:owner() == owner -- is true~
--- ```
---
--- The bound `owner` is passed in as the last parameter of the `get` and `set` functions.
---
--- ## 7. Extendable
--- A common use case is using metatables to provide shared fields and methods across multiple instances. A typical example might be:
---
--- ```lua
--- local person = {}
--- function person:name(newValue)
---     if newValue then
---         self._name = newValue
---     end
---     return self._name
--- end
---
--- function person.new(name)
---     local o = { _name = name }
---     return setmetatable(o, { __index = person })
--- end
---
--- local johnDoe = person.new("John Doe")
--- johnDoe:name() == "John Doe"
--- ```
---
--- If we want to make the `name` a property, we might try creating a bound property like this:
---
--- ```lua
--- person.name = prop(function(self) return self._name end, function(value, self) self._name = value end):bind(person)
--- ```
--- Unfortunately, this doesn't work as expected:
---
--- ```lua
--- johnDoe:name()          -- Throws an error because `person` is the owner, not `johnDoe`.
--- johnDoe.name() == nil   -- Works, but will return `nil` because "John Doe" is applied to the new table, not `person`
--- ```
---
--- The fix is to use `prop.extend` when creating the new person. Rewrite `person.new` like so:
---
--- ```lua
--- person.new(name)
---     local o = { _name = name }
---     return prop.extend(o, person)
--- end
--- ```
---
--- Now, this will work as expected:
---
--- ```lua
--- johnDoe:name() == "John Doe"
--- johnDoe.name() == "John Doe"
--- ```
---
--- The `prop.extend` function will set the `source` table as a metatable of the `target`, as well as binding any bound props that are in the `source` to `target`.
---
--- # Tables
---
--- Because tables are copied by reference rather than by value, changes made inside a table will not necessarily trigger an update when setting a value with an updated table value. By default, tables are simply passed in and out without modification. You can nominate for a property to make copies of tables (not userdata) when getting or setting, which effectively isolates the value being stored from outside modification. This can be done with the [deepTable](#deepTable) and[shallowTable](#shallowTable) methods. Below is an example of them in action:
---
--- ```lua
--- local value = { a = 1, b = { c = 1 } }
--- local valueProp = prop.THIS(value)
--- local deepProp = prop.THIS(value):deepTable()
--- local shallowProp = prop.THIS(value):shallowTable()
---
--- -- print a message when the prop value is updated
--- valueProp:watch(function(v) print("value: a = " .. v.a ..", b.c = ".. v.b.c ) end)
--- deepProp:watch(function(v) print("deep: a = " .. v.a ..", b.c = ".. v.b.c ) end)
--- shallowProp:watch(function(v) print("shallow: a = " .. v.a ..", b.c = ".. v.b.c ) end)
---
--- -- change the original table:
--- value.a             = 2
--- value.b.c           = 2
---
--- valueProp().a       == 2    -- modified
--- valueProp().b.c     == 2    -- modified
--- shallowProp().a     == 1    -- top level is copied
--- shallowProp().b.c   == 2    -- child tables are referenced
--- deepProp().a        == 1    -- top level is copied
--- deepProp().b.c      == 1    -- child tables are copied as well
---
--- -- get the 'value' property
--- value = valueProp()         -- returns the original value table
---
--- value.a             = 3     -- updates the original value table `a` value
--- value.b.c           = 3     -- updates the original `b` table's `c` value
---
--- valueProp(value)            -- nothing is printed, since it's still the same table
---
--- valueProp().a       == 3    -- still referencing the original table
--- valueProp().b.c     == 3    -- the child is still referenced too
--- shallowProp().a     == 1    -- still unmodified after the initial copy
--- shallowProp().b.c   == 3    -- still updated, since `b` was copied by reference
--- deepProp().a        == 1    -- still unmodified after initial copy
--- deepProp().b.c      == 1    -- still unmodified after initial copy
---
--- -- get the 'deep copy' property
--- value = deepProp()          -- returns a new table, with all child tables also copied.
---
--- value.a             = 4     -- updates the new table's `a` value
--- value.b.c           = 4     -- updates the new `b` table's `c` value
---
--- deepProp(value)             -- prints "deep: a = 4, b.c = 4"
---
--- valueProp().a       == 3    -- still referencing the original table
--- valueProp().b.c     == 3    -- the child is still referenced too
--- shallowProp().a     == 1    -- still unmodified after the initial copy
--- shallowProp().b.c   == 3    -- still referencing the original `b` table.
--- deepProp().a        == 4    -- updated to the new value
--- deepProp().b.c      == 4    -- updated to the new value
---
--- -- get the 'shallow' property
--- value = shallowProp()       -- returns a new table with top-level keys copied.
---
--- value.a             = 5     -- updates the new table's `a` value
--- value.b.c           = 5     -- updates the original `b` table's `c` value.
---
--- shallowProp(value)          -- prints "shallow: a = 5, b.c = 5"
---
--- valueProp().a       == 3    -- still referencing the original table
--- valueProp().b.c     == 5    -- still referencing the original `b` table
--- shallowProp().a     == 5    -- updated to the new value
--- shallowProp().b.c   == 5    -- referencing the original `b` table, which was updated
--- deepProp().a        == 4    -- unmodified after the last update
--- deepProp().b.c      == 4    -- unmodified after the last update
--- ```
---
--- So, a little bit tricky. The general rule of thumb is:
--- 1. If working with immutable objects, use the default 'value' value copy, which preserves the original.
--- 2. If working with an array of immutible objects, use the 'shallow' table copy.
--- 3. In most other cases, use a 'deep' table copy.

--- cp.prop:watch(watchFn[, notifyNow]) -> cp.prop, function
--- Method
--- Adds the watch function to the value. When the value changes, watchers are notified by calling the function. The function should have the following signature:
---
--- ```lua
--- function(value, owner, prop)
--- ```
---  * `value`  - The new value of the property
---  * `owner`  - The property owner. May be `nil`.
---  * `prop`   - The property itself.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `watchFn`        - The watch function, with the signature `function(newValue, owner)`.
---  * `notifyNow`  - The function will be triggered immediately with the current state.  Defaults to `false`.
---  * `uncloned`   - If `true`, the watch function will not be attached to any clones of this prop.
---
--- Returns:
---  * `cp.prop`        - The same `cp.prop` instance
---  * `function`   - The watch function, which can be passed to [unwatch](#unwatch) to stop watching.
---
--- Notes:
---  * You can watch immutable values. Wrapped `cp.prop` instances may not be immutable, and any changes to them will cause watchers to be notified up the chain.

--- cp.prop:unwatch(watchFn) -> boolean
--- Method
--- Removes the specified watch method as a watcher, if present. An example of adding and removing a watch:
---
--- ```lua

--- prop:unwatch(watcher) == true
--- ```
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `watchFn`        - The original watch function to remove. Must be the same instance that was added.

---  * `function`   - The watch function, which can be passed to [unwatch](#unwatch) to stop watching.
---
--- Notes:
---  * You can watch immutable values. Wrapped `cp.prop` instances may not be immutable, and any changes to them will cause watchers to be notified up the chain.

--- cp.prop:mutate(getFn[, setFn]) -> cp.prop <anything; read-only>, function
--- Method
--- Returns a new property that is a mutation of the current one.
--- Watchers of the mutant will be if a change in the current prop causes
--- the mutation to be a new value.
---
--- The `getFn` is a function with the following signature:
---
--- ```lua
--- function(original, owner, prop) --> mutantValue
--- ```
---
---  * `originalProp`   - The original `cp.prop` being mutated.
---  * `owner`          - The owner of the mutator property, if it has been bound.
---  * `mutantProp`     - The mutant property.
---  * `mutantValue`    - The new value based off the original.
---
--- You can ignore any parameters that you don't need. Most simply use the `original` prop.
---
--- The `setFn` is optional, and is a function with the following signature:
---
--- ```lua
--- function(mutantValue, original, owner, prop) --> nil
--- ```
---
---  * `mutantValue`    - The new value being sent in.
---  * `originalProp`   - The original property being mutated.
---  * `owner`          - The owner of the mutant property, if it has been bound.
---  * `mutantProp`     - The mutant property.
---
--- Again, you can ignore any parameters that you don't need.
--- If you want to set a new value to the `original` property, you can do so.
--- It's recommended that you use `original:set(...)`, which will allow setting `nil` values.
---
--- For example:
---
--- ```lua
--- anyNumber   = prop.THIS(1)
--- isEven      = anyNumber:mutate(function(original) return original() % 2 == 0 end)
---     :watch(function(even)
---         if even() then
---             print "even"
---         else
---             print "odd"
---         end
---     end)
---
--- isEven:update()     -- prints "odd"
--- anyNumber(10)       -- prints "even"
--- isEven() == true    -- no printing
--- ```
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `mutateFn`   - The function which will mutate the value of the current property.
---
--- Returns:
---  * A new `cp.prop` which will return a mutation of the property value.
function prop.mt:mutate(getFn, setFn)

--- cp.prop:NOT() -> cp.prop
--- Method
--- Returns a new `cp.prop` which negates the current value. Values are negated as follows:
---
---  * `boolean`    - Switch between `true` and `false`
---  * `nil`        - Switches to `true`
---  * <other>  - Switches to `nil`.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a `cp.prop` instance negating the current instance.
---
--- Notes:
---  * If this property is mutable, you can set the `NOT` property value and this property will be set to the negated value. Be aware that the same negation rules apply when setting as when getting.

-- cp.prop._watchAndOr(andOrProp, props) -> cp.prop
-- Private Function
-- Private function which will watch all props in `...` and update the `andOrProp` when they change.
--
-- Parameters:
-- * `andOrProp`    - The property that will get updated
-- * `props`        - The list of properties being watched.
--
-- Returns:
-- * The `andOrProp`.

--- cp.prop.AND(...) -> cp.prop
--- Function
--- Returns a new `cp.prop` which will be `true` if all `cp.prop` instances passed into the function return a `truthy` value.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `...`        - The list of `cp.prop` instances to 'AND' together.
---
--- Returns:
---  * a `cp.prop` instance.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The value of this instance will resolve by lazily checking the `value` of the contained `cp.prop` instances in the order provided. The first `falsy` value will be returned. Otherwise the last `truthy` value is returned.
---  * The instance is **immutable**.
---  * Once you have created an 'AND', you cannot 'OR' as a method. Eg, this will fail: `prop.TRUE():AND(prop:FALSE()):OR(prop.TRUE())`. This is to avoid ambiguity as to whether the 'AND' or 'OR' takes precedence. Is it `(true and false) or true` or `true and (false or true)`?.
---  * To combine 'AND' and 'OR' values, group them together when combining. Eg:
---  ** `(true and false) or true`: `prop.OR( prop.TRUE():AND(prop.FALSE()), prop.TRUE() )`
---  ** `true and (false or true)`: `prop.TRUE():AND( prop.FALSE():OR(prop.TRUE()) )`

--- cp.prop:AND(...) -> cp.prop
--- Method
--- Returns a new `cp.prop` which will be `true` if this and all other `cp.prop` instances passed into the function return `true`.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `...`        - The list of `cp.prop` instances to 'AND' together.

--- cp.prop.OR(...) -> cp.prop
--- Function
--- Returns a new `cp.prop` which will return the first 'truthy' value provided by one of the provided properties. Otherwise, returns the last 'falsy' value.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `...`        - The list of `cp.prop` instances to 'OR' together.
---
--- Returns:
---  * a `cp.prop` instance.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The value of this instance will resolve by lazily checking the `value` of the contained `cp.prop` instances in the order provided. If any return `true`, no further instances will be checked.
---  * The instance is immutable, since there is no realy way to flip the component values of an 'OR' in a way that makes sense.
---  * Once you have created an 'OR', you cannot 'AND' as a method. Eg, this will fail: `prop.TRUE():OR(prop:FALSE()):AND(prop.TRUE())`. This is to avoid ambiguity as to whether the 'OR' or 'AND' takes precedence. Is it `(true or false) and true` or `true or (false and true)`?.
---  * To combine 'AND' and 'OR' values, group them together when combining. Eg:
---  ** `(true or false) and true`: `prop.AND( prop.TRUE():OR(prop.FALSE()), prop.TRUE() )`
---  ** `true or (false and true)`: `prop.TRUE():OR( prop.FALSE():AND(prop.TRUE()) )`

-- rebind(target, source) -> table
-- Function
-- Copies and binds all 'method' properties on the source tables passed in to the `target` table. E.g.:
--
-- ```lua
-- local source, target = {}, {}
-- source.isMethod = prop.TRUE():bind(source)
-- source.isFunction = prop.TRUE()
-- prop.bindAll(target, source)
-- target:isMethod() == true
-- target.isFunction() -- error. The function was not copied.
-- ```
--
-- The original `prop` methods on the source will be rebound to the target.
--
-- Parameters:
-- * `target`   - The target table to copy the methods into.
-- * `source`   - The list of source tables to copy and bind methods from
--
-- Returns:
-- * The target
local function rebind(target, source)

--- cp.prop.extend(target, source) -> table
--- Function
--- Makes the `target` extend the `source`. It will copy all bound properties on the source table into the target, rebinding it to the target table. Other keys are inherited via the metatable.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `target` - The target to extend
---  * `source` - The source to extend from
---
--- Returns:
---  * The `target`, now extending the `source`.

--- cp.prop.bind(owner) -> function
--- Function
--- This provides a utility function for binding multiple properties to a single owner in
--- a simple way. To use, do something like this:
---
--- ```lua
--- local o = {}
--- prop.bind(o) {
---     foo = prop.TRUE(),
---     bar = prop.THIS("Hello world"),
--- }
--- ```
---
--- This is equivalent to the following:
---
--- ```lua
--- local o = {}
--- o.foo = prop.TRUE():bind(o):label("foo")
--- -- alternately...
--- prop.THIS("Hello world"):bind(o, "bar")
--- ```
---
--- It has the added benefit of checking that the target properties ('foo' and 'bar' in this case)
--- have not already been assigned a value.
---
--- Parameters:
--- * owner     - The owner table to bind the properties to.
---
--- Returns:
--- * A function which should be called, passing in a table of key/value pairs which are `string`/`cp.prop` value.
---
--- Notes:
--- * If you are binding multiple `cp.prop` values that are dependent on other `cp.prop` values on the same owner (e.g. via `mutate` or a boolean join), you
---   will have to break it up into multiple `prop.bind(...) {...}` calls, so that the dependent property can access the bound property.
--- * If a `cp.prop` provided as bindings already has a bound owner, it will be wrapped instead of bound directly.
function prop.bind(owner)
    return function(bindings)
        for k,v in pairs(bindings) do
            if not prop.is(v) then

            end
            local vOwner = v:owner()
            if vOwner == nil then -- it's unowned.
                v:bind(owner, k)
            elseif vOwner ~= owner then -- it's already owned. wrap instead.
                v:wrap(owner, k)
            end
        end
        return owner
    end
