--- === cp.battery ===
---
--- Provides access to various properties of the battery. Each of these properties
--- is a `cp.prop`, so it can be watched for changes. For example:
---
--- ```lua
--- local battery = require("cp.battery")
--- battery.powerSupply:watch(function(value)
---     print("Now using "..value)
--- end)
--- ```
---
--- This will `print` "Now using AC Power" or "Now using Battery Power" whenever the
--- power supply changes.
---
--- By default the watcher initialises in a "stopped" state, and must be started for
--- the `cp.prop` watchers to trigger.

--- cp.battery.amperage <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the amount of current flowing through the battery, in mAh.
---
--- Notes:
--- * A number containing the amount of current flowing through the battery. The value may be:
--- ** Less than zero if the battery is being discharged (i.e. the computer is running on battery power)
--- ** Zero if the battery is being neither charged nor discharded
--- ** Greater than zero if the bettery is being charged

--- cp.battery.capacity <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the current capacity of the battery in mAh.
---
--- Notes:
--- * This is the measure of how charged the battery is, vs the value of `cp.battery.maxCapacity()`.

--- cp.battery.cycles <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the number of discharge cycles of the battery.
---
--- Notes:
--- * One cycle is a full discharge of the battery, followed by a full charge. This may also be an aggregate of many smaller discharge-then-charge cycles (e.g. 10 iterations of discharging the battery from 100% to 90% and then charging back to 100% each time, is considered to be one cycle).

--- cp.battery.designCapacity <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the design capacity of the battery in mAh.

--- cp.battery.health <cp.prop: string; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the health status of the battery; either "Good", "Fair" or "Poor",
--- as determined by the Apple Smart Battery controller.

--- cp.battery.healthCondition <cp.prop: string; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the health condition status of the battery:
--- `nil` if there are no health conditions to report, or a string containing either:
--- * "Check Battery"
--- * "Permanent Battery Failure"

--- cp.battery.isCharged <cp.prop: boolean; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Checks if the battery is fully charged.

--- cp.battery.isCharging <cp.prop: boolean; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Checks if the battery is currently charging.

--- cp.battery.isFinishingCharge <cp.prop: boolean | string; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Checks if the battery is trickle charging;
--- either `true` if trickle charging, `false` if charging faster, or `"n/a" if the battery is not charging at all.

--- cp.battery.maxCapacity <cp.prop; number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the maximum capacity of the battery in mAh.
---
--- Notes:
--- * This may exceed the value of `cp.battery.designCapacity()` due to small variations in the production chemistry vs the design.

--- cp.battery.otherBatteryInfo <cp.prop: table | nil; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns information about non-PSU batteries (e.g. bluetooth accessories). If none are found, `nil` is returned.

--- cp.battery.percentage <cp.prop; string; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the current source of power; either `"AC Power"`, `"Battery Power"` or `"Off Line"`.

--- cp.battery.psuSerial <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the serial number of the attached power supply, or `0` if not present.

--- cp.battery.timeRemaining <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- The amount of battery life remaining, in minuges.
---
--- Notes:
--- * The return value may be:
--- ** Greater than zero to indicate the number of minutes remaining.
--- ** `-1` if the remaining batttery life is being calculated.
--- ** `-2` if there is unlimited time remaining (i.e. the system is on AC power).

--- cp.battery.timeToFullCharge <cp.prop; number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the time remaining for the battery to be fully charged, in minutes, or `-`` if still being calculated.

--- cp.battery.voltage <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the current voltage of the battery in mV.

--- cp.battery.watts <cp.prop: number; read-only>
--- Constant
--- Returns the power entering or leaving the battery, in W.
--- Discharging will be less than zero, charging greater than zero.
