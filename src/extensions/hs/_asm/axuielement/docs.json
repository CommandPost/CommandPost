An accessibility object represents any object or component of an OS X application which can be manipulated through the OS X Accessibility API -- it can be an application, a window, a button, selected text, etc.  As such, it can only support those features and objects within an application that the application developers make available through the Accessibility API.\n\nThe basic methods available to determine what attributes and actions are available for a given object are described in this reference documentation.  In addition, the module will dynamically add methods for the attributes and actions appropriate to the object, but these will differ between object roles and applications -- again we are limited by what the target application developers provide us.\n\nThe dynamically generated methods will follow one of the following templates:\n * `object:*attribute*()`         - this will return the value for the specified attribute (see [hs._asm.axuielement:attributeValue](#attributeValue) for the generic function this is based on).\n * `object:set*attribute*(value)` - this will set the specified attribute to the given value (see [hs._asm.axuielement:setAttributeValue](#setAttributeValue) for the generic function this is based on).\n * `object:do*action*()`          - this request that the specified action is performed by the object (see [hs._asm.axuielement:performAction](#performAction) for the generic function this is based on).\n\nWhere *action* and *attribute* can be the formal Accessibility version of the attribute or action name (a string usually prefixed with \"AX\") or without the \"AX\" prefix.  When the prefix is left off, the first letter of the action or attribute can be uppercase or lowercase.\n\nThe module also dynamically supports treating the axuielementObject useradata as an array, to access it's children (i.e. `#object` will return a number, indicating the number of direct children the object has, and `object[1]` is equivalent to `object:children()[1]` or, more formally, `object:attributeValue(\"AXChildren\")[1]`).\n\nYou can also treat the axuielementObject userdata as a table of key-value pairs to generate a list of the dynamically generated functions: `for k, v in pairs(object) do print(k, v) end` (this is essentially what [hs._asm.axuielement:dynamicMethods](#dynamicMethods) does).\n\n\nLimited support for parameterized attributes is provided, but is not yet complete.  This is expected to see updates in the future.",
