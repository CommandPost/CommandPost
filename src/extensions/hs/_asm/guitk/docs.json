Ultimately this module should be able to replace the other drawing or user interface modules and allow you to mix their components or even create completely new ones.\n\nBy itself, this module just creates the \"window\" and its methods describe how (or if) it should be visible, movable, etc. and provides a notification callback for potentially interesting events, for example when the \"window\" becomes visible, is moved, etc.\n\nSee `hs._asm.guitk.manager` for more information on how to populate a guitkObject with visual elements and `hs._asm.guitk.element` for a description of the currently supported visual elements which can included in a guitk window.",
