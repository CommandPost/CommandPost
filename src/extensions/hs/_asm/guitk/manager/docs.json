    "doc" : "This submodule provides a content manager for an `hs._asm.guitk` window that allows the placement and managerment of multiple gui elements.\n\nA manager can also act as an element to another manager -- this allows for the grouping of elements as single units for display or other purposes. See `hs._asm.guitk.element.button` for a further discussion of this when using the radio button style.\n\nElements can be added and managed through the methods of this module.  There are also metamethods which allow you to manipulate the elements in an array like fashion. Each element is represented as a table and can be accessed from the manager as if it were an array. Valid index numbers range from 1 to `#hs._asm.guitk.manager:elements()` when getting an element or its attributes, or 1 to `#hs._asm.guitk.manager:elements() + 1` when replacing or assigning a new element. To access the userdata representing a specific element you can use the following syntax: `hs._asm.guitk.manager[#]._element` or `hs._asm.guitk.manager(#)` where # is the index number or the string `id` specified in the `frameDetails` attribute described below.\n\nThe specific attributes of each element will depend upon the type of element (see `hs._asm.guitk.element`) and the following manager specific attributes:\n\n* `_element`     - A read-only attribute whos value is the userdata representing the gui element itself.\n* `_fittingSize` - A read-only size-table specifying the default height and width for the element. Not all elements have a default height or width and the value for one or more of these keys may be 0.\n* `_type`        - A read-only string indicating the userdata name for the element.\n* `frameDetails` - A table containing positioning and identification information about the element.  All of it's keys are optional and are as follows:\n  * `x`  - The horizontal position of the elements left side. Only one of `x`, `rX`, or`cX` can be set; setting one will clear the others.\n  * `rX`  - The horizontal position of the elements right side. Only one of `x`, `rX`, or`cX` can be set; setting one will clear the others.\n  * `cX` - The horizontal position of the elements center point. Only one of `x`, `rX`, or`cX` can be set; setting one will clear the others.\n  * `y`  - The vertical position of the elements top. Only one of `y`, `bY`, or `cY` can be set; setting one will clear the others.\n  * `bY`  - The vertical position of the elements bottom. Only one of `y`, `bY`, or `cY` can be set; setting one will clear the others.\n  * `cY` - The vertical position of the elements center point. Only one of `y`, `bY`, or `cY` can be set; setting one will clear the others.\n  * `h`  - The element's height. If this is set, it will be used instead of the default height as returned by the `_fittingSize` attribute. If the default height is 0, then this *must* be set or the element will be effectively invisible.\n  * `w`  - The element's width. If this is set, it will be used instead of the default width as returned by the `_fittingSize` attribute. If the default width is 0, then this *must* be set or the element will be effectively invisible.\n  * `id` - A string specifying an identifier which can be used to reference this element through the manager's metamethods without requiring knowledge of the element's index position.\n\n  * `honorCanvasMove` - A boolean, default nil (false), indicating whether or not the frame wrapper functions for `hs.canvas` objects should honor location changes when made with `hs.canvas:topLeft` or `hs.canvas:frame`. This is a (hopefully temporary) fix because canvas objects are not aware of the `hs._asm.guitk` frameDetails model for element placement.\n\n  * Note that `x`, `rX`, `cX`, `y`, `bY`, `cY`, `h`, and `w` may be specified as numbers or as strings representing percentages of the element's parent width (for `x`, `rX`, `cX`, and `w`) or height (for `y`, `bY`, `cY`, and `h`). Percentages should specified in the string as defined for your locale or in the `en_US` locale (as a fallback) which is either a number followed by a % sign or a decimal number.\n\n* When assigning a new element to the manager through the metamethods, you can assign the userdata directly or by using the table format described above. For example:\n\n~~~lua\nmanager = hs._asm.guitk.manager.new()\nmanager[1] = hs._asm.guitk.element.button.new(...)  -- direct assignment of the element\nmanager[2] = {                                      -- as a table\n  _element = hs._asm.guitk.element.button.new(...), -- the only time that `_element` can be assigned a value\n  frameDetails = { cX = \"50%\", cY = \"50%\" },\n  id = \"secondButton\", -- the only time that `id` can be set outside of the `frameDetails` table\n  -- other button specific attributes as defined in `hs._asm.guitk.element.button`\n}\n~~~\n\nYou can remove an existing element by setting its value to nil, e.g. `manager[1] = nil`.",

The key-value pairs of the details table will be the following:\n   * `pasteboard` - the name of the pasteboard that contains the items being dragged\n   * `sequence`   - an integer that uniquely identifies the dragging session.\n   * `mouse`      - a point table containing the location of the mouse pointer within the manager corresponding to when the callback occurred.\n   * `operation`  - a table containing string descriptions of the type of dragging the source application supports. Potentially useful for determining if your callback function should accept the dragged item or not.\n\n* The possible messages the callback function may receive are as follows:\n   * \"enter\"   - the user has dragged an item into the manager.  When your callback receives this message, you can optionally return false to indicate that you do not wish to accept the item being dragged.\n   * \"exit\"    - the user has moved the item out of the manager; if the previous \"enter\" callback returned false, this message will also occur when the user finally releases the items being dragged.\n   * \"receive\" - indicates that the user has released the dragged object while it is still within the element frame.  When your callback receives this message, you can optionally return false to indicate to the sending application that you do not want to accept the dragged item -- this may affect the animations provided by the sending application.\n\n * You can use the sequence number in the details table to match up an \"enter\" with an \"exit\" or \"receive\" message.\n\n * You should capture the details you require from the drag-and-drop operation during the callback for \"receive\" by using the pasteboard field of the details table and the `hs.pasteboard` module.  Because of the nature of \"promised items\", it is not guaranteed that the items will still be on the pasteboard after your callback completes handling this message.\n\n * A manager object can only accept drag-and-drop items when the `hs._asm.guitk` window the manager ultimately belongs to is at a level of `hs._asm.guitk.levels.dragging` or lower.
