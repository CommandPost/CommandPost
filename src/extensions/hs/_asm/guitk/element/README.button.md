### Module Constructors

<a name="buttonType"></a>
~~~lua
button.buttonType(type, [frame]) -> buttonObject
~~~
Creates a new button element of the specified type for `hs._asm.guitk`.

Parameters:
 * `button` - a string specifying the type of button to create. The string must be one of the following:
   * "momentaryLight"        - When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated. If the button has borders, it may also appear recessed. When the button is released, it returns to its normal (off) state. This type of button is best for simply triggering actions because it doesnâ€™t show its state; it always displays its normal image or title.
   * "pushOnPushOff"         - When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated. If the button has borders, it may also appear recessed. A second click returns it to its normal (off) state.
   * "toggle"                - After the first click, the button displays its alternate image or title (on state); a second click returns the button to its normal (off) state.
   * "switch"                - This style is a variant of "toggle" that has no border and is typically used to represent a checkbox.
   * "radio"                 - This style is similar to "switch", but it is used to constrain a selection to a single element from several elements.
   * "momentaryChange"       - When the button is clicked, the alternate (on state) image and alternate title are displayed. Otherwise, the normal (off state) image and title are displayed.
   * "onOff"                 - The first click highlights the button; a second click returns it to the normal (unhighlighted) state.
   * "momentaryPushIn"       - When the user clicks the button (on state), the button appears illuminated. Most buttons in macOS, such as Cancel button in many dialogs, are momentary light buttons. If you click one, it highlights briefly, triggers an action, and returns to its original state.
   * "accelerator"           - On pressure-sensitive systems, such as systems with the Force Touch trackpad, an accelerator button sends repeating actions as pressure changes occur. It stops sending actions when the user releases pressure entirely. Only available in macOS 10.12 and newer.
   * "multiLevelAccelerator" - A multilevel accelerator button is a variation of a normal accelerator button that allows for a configurable number of stepped pressure levels. As each one is reached, the user receives light tactile feedback and an action is sent. Only available in macOS 10.12 and newer.
 * `frame` - an optional frame table specifying the position and size of the frame for the button.

Returns:
 * a new buttonObject

Notes:
 * In most cases, setting the frame is not necessary and will be overridden when the element is assigned to a manager or to a `hs._asm.guitk` window.

<a name="buttonWithImage"></a>
~~~lua
button.buttonWithImage(image) -> buttonObject
~~~
Creates a new button element of the specified of type "momentaryPushIn" with the specified title for `hs._asm.guitk`.

Parameters:
 * `image` - the `hs.image` object specifying the image to display in the button.

Returns:
 * a new buttonObject

Notes:
 * This creates a standard macOS push button with the image centered within the button.
 * The default frame created will be the minimum size necessary to display the button with the image. If you need to adjust the button's size further, do so with the element frame details options available once the button element is attached to a guitk manager (see `hs._asm.guitk.manager`)

 * This constructor uses an NSButton initializer introduced with macOS 10.12; for macOS versions prior to this, this module attempts to mimic the appearance and behavior of the button using the equivalent of [hs._asm.guitk.element.button.buttonType](#buttonType) and the other methods within this module. If you believe that something has been missed in the fallback initializer, please submit an issue to the Hammerspoon github site.

<a name="radioButton"></a>
~~~lua
button.radioButton(title) -> buttonObject
~~~
Creates a new radio button element of the specified of type "radio" with the specified title for `hs._asm.guitk`.

Parameters:
 * `title` - the title which will be displayed next to the radio button

Returns:
 * a new buttonObject

Notes:
 * This creates a standard macOS radio button with the title next to it.
   * Only one radio button in the same manager can be active (selected) at one time; multiple radio buttons in the same manager are treated as a group or set.
   * To display multiple independent radio button sets in the same window or view (manager), each group must be in a separate `hs._asm.guitk.manager` object and these separate objects may then be assigned as elements to a "parent" manager which is assigned to the `hs._asm.guitk` window; alternatively use [hs._asm.guitk.element.button.radioButtonSet](#radioBUttonSet)

 * The default frame created will be the minimum size necessary to display the checkbox with its title. If you need to adjust the button's size further, do so with the element frame details options available once the button element is attached to a guitk manager (see `hs._asm.guitk.manager`)

<a name="radioButtonSet"></a>
~~~lua
button.radioButtonSet(...) -> managerObject
~~~
Creates an `hs._asm.guitk.manager` object which can be used as an element containing a set of radio buttons with labels defined by the specified title strings.

Parameters:
 `...` - a single table of strings, or list of strings separated by commas, specifying the labels to assign to the radion buttons in the set.

Returns:
 * a new managerObject which can be used as an element to another `hs._asm.guitk.manager` or assigned to an `hs._asm.guitk` window directly.

Notes:
 * Radio buttons in the same view (manager) are treated as related and only one can be selected at a time. By grouping radio button sets in separate managers, these independant managers can be assigned to a parent manager and each set will be seen as independent -- each set can have a selected item independent of the other radio sets which may also be displayed in the parent.

 * For example:
~~~ lua
    g = require("hs._asm.guitk")
    m = g.new{ x = 100, y = 100, h = 100, w = 130 }:contentManager(g.manager.new()):contentManager():show()
    m[1] = g.element.button.radioButtonSet(1, 2, 3, 4)
    m[2] = g.element.button.radioButtonSet{"abc", "d", "efghijklmn"}
    m(2):moveRightOf(m(1), 10, "centered")
~~~

See [hs._asm.guitk.element.button.radioButton](#radioButton) for more details.

### Module Methods

<a name="allowsMixedState"></a>
~~~lua
button:allowsMixedState([state]) -> buttonObject | boolean
~~~
Get or set whether the button allows for a mixed state in addition to "on" and "off"

Parameters:
 * `state` - an optional boolean specifying whether the button allows for a mixed state

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the buttonObject ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * Mixed state is typically useful only with buttons of type "switch" or "radio" and is primarily used to indicate that something is only applied partially, e.g. when part of a selection of text is bold but not all of it. When a checkbox or radio button is in the "mixed" state, it is displayed with a dash instead of an X or a filled in radio button.
 * See also [hs._asm.guitk.element.button:state](#state)

<a name="alternateImage"></a>
~~~lua
button:alternateImage([image]) -> buttonObject | hs.image object | nil
~~~
Get or set the alternate image displayed by button types which support this

Parameters:
 * `image` - an optional hs.image object, or explicit nil to remove, specifying the alternate image for the button.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the buttonObject ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * For buttons which change their appearance based upon their state, this is the image which will be displayed when the button is in its "on" state.

 * Observation shows that the alternateImage value is used by the following button types:
   * "toggle"          - the button will alternate between the image and the alternateImage
   * "momentaryChange" - if the button is not bordered, the alternate image will be displayed while the user is clicking on the button and will revert back to the image once the user has released the mouse button.///    * "switch"               - when the checkbox is checked, it will display its alternateImage as the checked box, if one has been assigned
   * "radio"           - when the radio button is selected, it will display its alternateImage as the filled in radio button, if one has been assigned
 * Other button types have not been observed to use this attribute; if you believe you have discovered something we have missed here, please submit an issue to the Hamemrspoon github web site.

Notes:
 * For buttons which change their appearance based upon their state, this is the title which will be displayed when the button is in its "on" state.

 * Observation shows that the alternateTitle value is used by the following button types:
   * "toggle"          - the button will alternate between the title and the alternateTitle
   * "momentaryChange" - if the button is not bordered, the alternate title will be displayed while the user is clicking on the button and will revert back to the title once the user has released the mouse button.
   * "switch"          - when the checkbox is checked, it will display its alternateTitle, if one has been assigned
   * "radio"           - when the radio button is selected, it will display its alternateTitle, if one has been assigned
 * Other button types have not been observed to use this attribute; if you believe you have discovered something we have missed here, please submit an issue to the Hamemrspoon github web site.

~~~lua
button:value([float]) -> integer | double
~~~
Get the current value represented by the button's state

Parameters:
 * `float` - an optional boolean specifying whether or not the value should be returned as a number (true) or as an integer (false). Defaults to false.

Returns:
 * The current value of the button as represented by its state.

Notes:
 * In general, this method will return 0 when the button's state is "off" and 1 when the button's state is "on" -- see [hs._asm.guitk.element.button:state](#state).
 * If [hs._asm.guitk.element.button:allowsMixedState](#allowsMixedState) has been set to true for this button, this method will return -1 when the button's state is "mixed".

 * If the button is of the "accelerator" type and the user is using a Force Touch capable trackpad, you can pass `true` to this method to get a relative measure of the amount of pressure being applied; this method will return a number between 1.0 and 2.0 representing the amount of pressure being applied when `float` is set to true.  If `float` is false or left out, then an "accelerator" type button will just return 1 as long as any pressure is being applied to the button.

 * If the button is of the "multiLevelAccelerator" type and the user is using a Force Touch capable trackpad, this method will return a number between 0 (not being pressed) up to the value set for [hs._asm.guitk.element.button:maxAcceleratorLevel](#maxAcceleratorLevel), depending upon how much pressure is being applied to the button.
