May be one of the following values:\n    * `notTracking`   - The touch has completed and no further path updates with this pathIndex will occur\n    * `startInRange`  - This is a newly detected touch\n    * `hoverInRange`  - The touch is hovering slightly above the touch device; not always observed in a full touch path.\n    * `makeTouch`     - The touch has actually made full contact with the touch device; not always observed in a full touch path.\n    * `touching`      - The touch is established. The touch will be in this stage for the majority of its lifetime.\n    * `breakTouch`    - The touch has been lifted from the touch device.\n    * `lingerInRange` - The touch has been lifted but is still within the range of hover detection.\n    * `outOfRange`    - The touch has moved out of range; This may occur because the touch has ended and will be followed by a `notTracking` message or it can occur if the touch moves out of the touch sensitive area of the device; if the touch returns to the touch sensitive area quickly enough, the touch may continue with `touching` messages.  Otherwise a new touch with a new `pathIndex` and `fingerID` will be generated if the touch returns.\n  * `fingerID`         - an integer which appears to be related to the location of the touch device where the touch was first detected; however this is not known for certain.

Note that the possible range for the values available in this table appears to be device dependent and does not appear to be related in an obvious way to the devices surface dimensions as returned by [hs._asm.undocumented.touchdevice:surfaceDimensions](#surfaceDimensions).\n    * `position` - a table representing the position of the touch\n      * `x` - a number indicating the horizontal position of the touch.

Because this module relies on an undocumented framework, these descriptions are based on the collection of observations made by a variety of people and shared on the internet -- nothing in here is guaranteed.  If you have corrected information or observe something in variance with what is documented here, please submit an issue with as much detail as possible.\n\nThe table will contain the following key-value pairs:\n  * `frame`            - an integer specifying the observation frame this touch belongs to\n  * `timestamp`        - a number representing the timestamp for the touch data in seconds; the epoch (0.0 point) is uncertain, but for a given device, the number will always be increasing throughout the detection of touches for the device.\n  * `pathIndex`        - an integer representing the path through the various stages for a touch; as long as a specific touch has not been broken (i.e. reached the \"notTracking\" stage), it's path ID will remain constant even though it's relative position in the table of touches returned in a frame callback may differ.\n  * `stage`            - a string representing the stage of the touch.  May be one of the following values:\n    * `notTracking`   - The touch has completed and no further path updates with this pathIndex will occur\n    * `startInRange`  - This is a newly detected touch\n    * `hoverInRange`  - The touch is hovering slightly above the touch device; not always observed in a full touch path.\n    * `makeTouch`     - The touch has actually made full contact with the touch device; not always observed in a full touch path.\n    * `touching`      - The touch is established. The touch will be in this stage for the majority of its lifetime.\n    * `breakTouch`    - The touch has been lifted from the touch device.\n    * `lingerInRange` - The touch has been lifted but is still within the range of hover detection.\n    * `outOfRange`    - The touch has moved out of range; This may occur because the touch has ended and will be followed by a `notTracking` message or it can occur if the touch moves out of the touch sensitive area of the device; if the touch returns to the touch sensitive area quickly enough, the touch may continue with `touching` messages.  Otherwise a new touch with a new `pathIndex` and `fingerID` will be generated if the touch returns.\n  * `fingerID`         - an integer which appears to be related to the location of the touch device where the touch was first detected; however this is not known for certain.
