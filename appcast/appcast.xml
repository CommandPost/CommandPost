			<description><![CDATA[
				<h2>Woohoo! ðŸŽ‰</h2>
				<p>After 78 releases of FCPX Hacks and 91 beta releases of CommandPost, we're extremely excited to announce that we're finally removing the beta label from CommandPost. With over 3300 active monthly users and over 1253 users in our Facebook Community, we're very happy with the progress CommandPost has made over the last 3 years and we can't wait to show you what we have in-store for future releases!</p>
				<p>Whilst CommandPost will always remain free and open source, we would love you to sponsor CommandPost via GitHub. Sponsorship will enable us to prioritise more time towards CommandPost development, letting us add new features, improve efficiency and reliability, and add new software and hardware support. GitHub will kindly match user contributions up to USD$5,000 until November 2020, as well as cover all transaction costs, so 100% of your contribution hits our bank account. You can learn more on our <a href="https://commandpost.io/#sponsor">website</a>.</p>
				<p>Thanks so much to the entire CommandPost community for all your help and support over the last 3 years!</p>

				<h2>New in 1.0.4:</h2>

				<h2>Bug Fix:</h2>
				<ul><li>Fixes a bug introduced in 1.0.3 that can prevent Effects & Generators from being applied correctly. Thanks for reporting Anton Lopez & Wayne Kopping!</li></ul>

				<hr />

				<h2>New in 1.0.3:</h2>

				<h2>New Feature:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added option to "Use Better Quality in Angles Viewer" in the Advanced Final Cut Pro Preferences.</li></ul>

				<h2>Improvements:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added a preference to enable or disable the Text Pasteboard History, and also set a History Size in the Finder Preferences panel. The Text Pasteboard History is now off by default.</li>
				<li>CommandPost now disconnects from Tangent Hub when the Color Finale 2 window is open, allowing you to control Color Finale 2 with Tangent Panels. When you close the Color Finale 2 window, CommandPost reconnects to Tangent Hub.</li></ul>

				<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
				<ul><li>The "Select Active/Topmost Library in Browser" actions now put focus on the Browser Sidebar when triggered so that the Library becomes active in the Inspector. Thanks for reporting Mads Larsen Nielsen!</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where Final Cut Pro could freeze temporarily when importing clips from a Media Watch Folder notification. Thanks for reporting Corky Ballas!</li></ul>

				<hr />

				<h2>New in 1.0.2:</h2>

				<h3>New Features:</h3>
				<ul><li>You can now apply multiple Compressor presets to the same watch folder.</li>
				<li>Added Final Cut Pro X preference for "Correct Spelling Automatically". Thanks for the suggestion Afshin Rohani!</li>
				<li>Added support for IFTTT Notifications. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/JFtechOfficial">JFtechOfficial</a> for implementing!</li>
				<li>Added action for "Select Topmost Library in Browser" and "Select Active Library in Browser". Thanks for the suggestion Mads Larsen Nielsen!</li></ul>

				<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
				<ul><li>Improved reliability of "Change Duration" menu item action. Thanks for reporting Vigneswaran Rajkumar.</li>
				<li>Fixed the naming of destinations in Timeline Batch Export if you have a fresh install of Final Cut Pro X without any custom destinations.</li>
				<li>Updated the Final Cut Pro, Motion & Compressor Feedback Form assistant.</li>
				<li>Fixed bug when disabling the Custom Touch Bar on Mojave.</li></ul>

				<h3>Workarounds:</h3>
				<ul><li>The Touch Bar features are currently not working correctly on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro so we have temporarily disabled Touch Bar support on these machines until we can come up with a proper fix. If anyone has any ideas, please get in touch.</li></ul>

				<h3>Translations:</h3>
				<ul><li>Added Hungarian Translation. Thanks Gyula HegedÃ¼s!</li></ul>

				<hr />

				<h2>New in 1.0.1:</h2>

				<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
				<ul><li>Fixed a bug where the Timeline Batch Export feature would not list all the installed Destination Presets. Thanks for reporting Edgar Davis!</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where Snippets assigned as an action (i.e. as a keyboard shortcut) would not trigger the latest Snippet code if the Snippet was updated in the Preferences panel after being assigned. Thanks for reporting Stefan Benz!</li></ul>

				<h3>New Additions:</h3>
				<ul><li>Added Polish Translation. Thanks Robert!</li></ul>

				<h2>New in Beta 91:</h2>

				<ul><li>CommandPost Beta 91 supports Final Cut Pro 10.4.4 or later (including 10.4.7).</li>
				<li>The Loupedeck+ Preferences panel now offers additional banks with a "Fn" suffix which allow you to have different actions when you hold down the "Fn" key (similar to the native Loupedeck+ application). You can still use the Fn key as a standalone button if desired.</li>
				<li>Fixed bug which prevented any Final Cut Pro Menu Actions with "delete" in the name to work correctly.</li>
				<li>Improved Performance of Command Editor Shortcut Actions, so they don't feel laggy on MIDI Devices (for example).</li>
				<li>Added actions for "Go to Next/Previous Frame (with muted audio)". This temporarily mutes your speaker so that you can go frame by frame without sound.</li>
				<li>Optimised various plugins to improve startup time.</li>
				<li>Replaced "Paypal Donation to Developers" with "Sponsor CommandPost", which now points to the main CommandPost website.</li></ul>
