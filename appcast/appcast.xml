				<li>Added a new Search panel to the HUD that allows you to search all the Final Cut Pro Browser Columns. This is useful if you have Notes on keyword ranges (i.e. when using Simon Says).</li>

				<hr />

				<ul><li>General improvements and bug fixes for the HUD. The "Find" shortcut now works correctly. We've added a "Clear" button to the Pasteboard & FCPXML Panels. We've disabled dragging and dropping to the code editor on the Pasteboard & FCPXML Panels to avoid confusion.</li></ul>

				<hr />

				<h2>New in Beta 45:</h2>
				<ul><li>We've completely rewritten the HUD. It now uses a panel system, so that we can add additional functionality to it over time. Like Final Cut Pro Workflow Extensions, the HUD now remembers its position per Workspace, and also has window snapping. We've added lots more buttons - there's a panel with 10, 12 and 24 customisable buttons (just right click on them to assign an action or rename them). We've also added a FCPXML and Pasteboard editor, as well as a system and per-library notes system, so that your notes travel with your Final Cut Pro library. Enjoy!</li></ul>

				<h2>Preparing for latest beta:</h2>
				<p>CommandPost now comes with a one-click uninstall application that’s included in the download package. It will remove EVERYTHING CommandPost related from your system. Because Beta 30 was quite a major update, we recommend running the uninstaller first, to give CommandPost a completely fresh start if you've previously installed an earlier beta. You can find the uninstaller in the installation package when you download CommandPost from the website: <a href="https://commandpost.io">https://commandpost.io</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[
				<p>Thank you so much for testing out CommandPost! We are <strong>HUGELY</strong> appreciative of everyone's help, support, ideas, comments and advice!</p>

				<p>The Beta 22 update was a fairly major one, so we'd recommend trashing your CommandPost Preferences (by holding down <strong>OPTION+COMMAND</strong> on launch) if you were previously using Beta 21 or earlier. Enjoy!</p>

				<p><em>Best Regards, Chris Hocking &amp; David Peterson</em></p>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 29:</h2>
				<ul><li>The Batch Export tool has been revamped and improved. You can now Batch Export from both the Browser and the Timeline. There are individual actions and menu bar items for both Browser & Timeline Batch Export, as well as a generic “Batch Export” action that’s context aware - and will pick the Browser or Timeline tool based on your mouse location.</li>
				<li>Added Individual Color Wheel reset actions.</li>
				<li>The Color Inspector API now recognises the wheels correctly when you’re in “Single Wheels” view, but have a wide inspector, so that all four wheels are visible.</li>
				<li>The “Open Error Log On Dock Icon Click” feature is now on by default.</li>
				<li>Renamed "Copy Pasteboard Markers to Selected Clip in Browser" to "Paste Markers to Selected Clip in Browser from Pasteboard" to avoid confusion.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug with the Scrolling Timeline feature.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug in the "MIDI: Color Wheel Master Brightness" action.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug with Static Text UI Items.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug in the Final Cut Pro Plugins API.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where CommandPost would incorrectly load the Color Board on Final Cut Pro Launch.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug in the Color Inspector Corrections Bar which would cause the changing of the Corrections type to sometimes fail.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 28:</h2>
				<ul><li>Fixes an annoying and dangerous bug in Final Cut Pro 10.4.1, where if you perform a "lasso" selection with your mouse in the timeline, random clips outside of the visible timeline area can also be selected without you realising.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 27:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added "Copy Pasteboard Markers to Selected Clip in Browser" feature, which allows you to add multiple standard and to-do markers and favourite ranges to a selected clip in the browser via specifically formatted text stored on the clipboard. Thanks David Tillman for the suggestion!</li>
				<li>Any references to "Clipboard" are now changed to "Pasteboard" to keep in line with macOS Naming Conventions.</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in "Enable Waveform Drawing".</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in Console that prevented Logic Audio effects from being correctly selected. Thanks Michael Lunt for reporting!</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in "Change Backup Interval". Thanks Sebastian Leitner for reporting!</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 26:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added a new plugin to automatically mount/unmount external drives when plugging/unplugging into AC power.</li>
				<li>Brightness & Saturation controls on Tangent Panels are now slightly more sensitive.</li>
				<li>Additional Color Inspector related functions have been added to Tangent Mapper.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 25:</h2>
				<ul><li>CommandPost now gives control of Tangent panels to ColorFinale when the ColorFinale window is activated, and restores control once the ColorFinale window is closed.</li>
				<li>Fixed bugs in Tangent Video Inspector & Timeline Zoom controls.</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in Color Inspector MIDI controls that prevented knobs/sliders from going to zero values.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 24:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added Final Cut Pro Playback Controls to Tangent Mapper.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where the MIDI Editor in MIDI Preferences would sometimes randomly disappear. Thanks for reporting Iain Anderson!</li>
				<li>Added the ability to control any Final Cut Pro User Interface Element via a MIDI Knob/Slider with Absolute or Relative Values.</li>
				<li>The MMC & MTC Device dropdown lists in the MIDI Preferences are now seperate Physical and Virtual MIDI Devices. Thanks for spotting Mark Edwards!</li>
				<li>Fixed bug when trying to trigger the "Toggle Stabilisation" action. Thanks for spotting Ira Edelman!</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 23:</h2>
				<ul><li>This release contains some bug fixes for the Color Board MIDI Controls. Thanks to Iain Anderson for reporting. Also, the selected MIDI bank now changes when you change the bank via the drop down menu in the MIDI Preferences Panel.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 22:</h2>
				<ul><li>General Stability &amp; Performance Improvements across the board, with lots of bug fixes.</li>
				<li>The Tangent functionality has been completely revamped and rewritten. It now supports the Color Wheels and Video Inspector. We've added a "Favourites" feature which allows you to easily add ANY action within CommandPost as an option within Tangent Mapper. MASSIVE thank you to Andy Knox and the team at Tangent for all their help and support!</li>
				<li>The MIDI Plugin has been vastly improved and expanded upon. It now supports the Color Wheels and Video Inspector. We've also added MIDI Banks and some default values to speed up the setup time. Initial support of MIDI Machine Control &amp; MIDI Time Code has been added, however expect improvements to these features in a future beta release. MASSIVE thank you to Andrew Madsen for all his help with the MIKMIDI Framework.</li>
				<li>We've added 15 new languages to CommandPost. The translations have been done automatically by Google &amp; Microsoft, so we expect mistakes, and would HUGELY appreciate it if you can report any translation mistakes so we can fix promptly.</li>
				<li>You can now customise the modifier key when using Timeline Zoom with your mouse scroll wheel and/or Magic Mouse.</li>
				<li>The option to "Control CommandPost Shortcuts within Final Cut Pro" on the initial installation has been removed, however you can still enable it via the Final Cut Pro Preferences panel in CommandPost. We will improve this feature in a future beta.</li>
				<li>Improvements and Enhancements to the Batch Export tool.</li>
				<li>The Text-to-speech tool has been completely revamped with a lot more power and flexibility.</li>
				<li>The Keyword Features have been improved.</li>
				<li>New built-in Stream Deck Icons by Daniele Di Tuccio.</li>
				<li>The WebApp plugin is now disabled by default until we fix it properly.</li></ul>

				<p>The Beta 22 update was a fairly major one, so we'd recommend trashing your CommandPost Preferences (by holding down <strong>OPTION+COMMAND</strong> on launch) if you were previously using Beta 21 or earlier. Enjoy!</p>

				<h2>What's New in Beta 28:</h2>
				<ul><li>Fixes an annoying and dangerous bug in Final Cut Pro 10.4.1, where if you perform a "lasso" selection with your mouse in the timeline, random clips outside of the visible timeline area can also be selected without you realising.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 27:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added "Copy Pasteboard Markers to Selected Clip in Browser" feature, which allows you to add multiple standard and to-do markers and favourite ranges to a selected clip in the browser via specifically formatted text stored on the clipboard. Thanks David Tillman for the suggestion!</li>
				<li>Any references to "Clipboard" are now changed to "Pasteboard" to keep in line with macOS Naming Conventions.</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in "Enable Waveform Drawing".</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in Console that prevented Logic Audio effects from being correctly selected. Thanks Michael Lunt for reporting!</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in "Change Backup Interval". Thanks Sebastian Leitner for reporting!</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 26:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added a new plugin to automatically mount/unmount external drives when plugging/unplugging into AC power.</li>
				<li>Brightness & Saturation controls on Tangent Panels are now slightly more sensitive.</li>
				<li>Additional Color Inspector related functions have been added to Tangent Mapper.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 25:</h2>
				<ul><li>CommandPost now gives control of Tangent panels to ColorFinale when the ColorFinale window is activated, and restores control once the ColorFinale window is closed.</li>
				<li>Fixed bugs in Tangent Video Inspector & Timeline Zoom controls.</li>
				<li>Fixed bug in Color Inspector MIDI controls that prevented knobs/sliders from going to zero values.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 24:</h2>
				<ul><li>Added Final Cut Pro Playback Controls to Tangent Mapper.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where the MIDI Editor in MIDI Preferences would sometimes randomly disappear. Thanks for reporting Iain Anderson!</li>
				<li>Added the ability to control any Final Cut Pro User Interface Element via a MIDI Knob/Slider with Absolute or Relative Values.</li>
				<li>The MMC & MTC Device dropdown lists in the MIDI Preferences are now seperate Physical and Virtual MIDI Devices. Thanks for spotting Mark Edwards!</li>
				<li>Fixed bug when trying to trigger the "Toggle Stabilisation" action. Thanks for spotting Ira Edelman!</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 23:</h2>
				<ul><li>This release contains some bug fixes for the Color Board MIDI Controls. Thanks to Iain Anderson for reporting. Also, the selected MIDI bank now changes when you change the bank via the drop down menu in the MIDI Preferences Panel.</li></ul>

				<hr />
				<h2>What's New in Beta 22:</h2>
				<ul><li>General Stability &amp; Performance Improvements across the board, with lots of bug fixes.</li>
				<li>The Tangent functionality has been completely revamped and rewritten. It now supports the Color Wheels and Video Inspector. We've added a "Favourites" feature which allows you to easily add ANY action within CommandPost as an option within Tangent Mapper. MASSIVE thank you to Andy Knox and the team at Tangent for all their help and support!</li>
				<li>The MIDI Plugin has been vastly improved and expanded upon. It now supports the Color Wheels and Video Inspector. We've also added MIDI Banks and some default values to speed up the setup time. Initial support of MIDI Machine Control &amp; MIDI Time Code has been added, however expect improvements to these features in a future beta release. MASSIVE thank you to Andrew Madsen for all his help with the MIKMIDI Framework.</li>
				<li>We've added 15 new languages to CommandPost. The translations have been done automatically by Google &amp; Microsoft, so we expect mistakes, and would HUGELY appreciate it if you can report any translation mistakes so we can fix promptly.</li>
				<li>You can now customise the modifier key when using Timeline Zoom with your mouse scroll wheel and/or Magic Mouse.</li>
				<li>The option to "Control CommandPost Shortcuts within Final Cut Pro" on the initial installation has been removed, however you can still enable it via the Final Cut Pro Preferences panel in CommandPost. We will improve this feature in a future beta.</li>
				<li>Improvements and Enhancements to the Batch Export tool.</li>
				<li>The Text-to-speech tool has been completely revamped with a lot more power and flexibility.</li>
				<li>The Keyword Features have been improved.</li>
				<li>New built-in Stream Deck Icons by Daniele Di Tuccio.</li>
				<li>The WebApp plugin is now disabled by default until we fix it properly.</li></ul>

				<h4>New Feature:</h4>
				<ul><li>CommandPost now offers native support of the entire range of Tangent's panels, including the Element, Wave, Ripple, the Element-Vs iPad app, and any future Tangent panels. All actions within CommandPost can be assigned to any Tangent panel button/wheel using Tangent's Mapper application. This allows you to create your own layouts and modes. Currently we only support controlling the Color Board and Timeline Zoom with the wheels, however full Color Inspector support will be added in a future beta. As this functionality is new, your feedback and testing is greatly appreciated (issue #906)</li></ul>

				<h4>Improvements:</h4>
				<ul><li>Toggling Developer Mode no longer requires restarting CommandPost (issue #899)</li>
				<li>Add option to Advanced Preferences & Error Log button to Enable/Disable Auto-Reload (issue #910)</li></ul>

				<h4>Bug Fixes:</h4>
				<ul><li>Global Commands not being correctly listed on some machines (issue #897)</li>
				<li>MIDI Commands incorrectly triggering twice on some devices (issue #915)</li>
				<li>"Control CommandPost Shortcuts within Final Cut Pro" now works with Final Cut Pro 10.4 (issue #896)</li></ul>
